X-Symbol
********

   When you edit LaTeX, HTML, BibTeX or TeXinfo sources in Emacs,
package X-Symbol provides some kind of WYSIWYG by using real characters
for tokens like `\oplus' or `&trade;'.  It also provides various input
methods to insert these characters.  Thumbnails for included images and
real super-/subscripts and are also supported.

   The first part of this master menu lists the major nodes in this Info
document, including the indexes.  The rest of the menu lists all the
lower level nodes in the document.

rights.

   Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone

Brief Summary of X-Symbol
=========================

   * X-Symbol provides a *minor mode* which make use of characters in
     the Latin-1, Latin-2, Latin-3, Latin-5, and Latin-9 font (179
     chars + 294 char aliases), the Adobe symbol font (109 chars) and
     the xsymb1 font (165 chars, distributed with the package).
     Additional fonts could be used easily.

   * These characters are used in the buffer to represent *tokens*
     (e.g., TeX macros, SGML entities, more "token languages" could be
     added easily) in the file.  The *conversion* is done automatically
     when visiting the file, saving the buffer and turning the minor
     mode on/off.

   * Defines 8 *input methods* for these characters: *Menu*, *Grid*
     (selecting a character with the mouse), *Keyboard*, *Context*
     (replace/modify similar-looking char sequence), *Electric*
     (automatic replace), *Quail* (a Mule input method), *Token*
     (replace token by corresponding char), *Read Token* (completing
     minibuffer input of token).

   * Offers some *info* in the echo area for these characters (e.g.,
     that the character under point represents the TeX macro `\leadsto'
     and that the macro is defined in LaTeX package `latexsym.sty').

   * Allows to use a *8bit file encoding* which is different from your
     "normal" 8bit file encoding, e.g., you can visit TeX files with
     `\usepackage[latin5]{inputenc}' even if you normally use a Latin-2
     font.

   * Provides a kind of "*poor man's Mule*" when running on an XEmacs
     without Mule support: it can *display* more than 256 characters
     via `font-lock' and removes most annoyances resulting from the
     fact that, without Mule support, many "X-Symbol characters" are
     actually a sequence of two chars.

   * Provides fonts for single-line innermost *super-* and *subscripts*
     to be displayed with per-buffer control. The invisible part, like
     `<sub>' in HTML, is revealed at point.

   * Displays thumbnails for *images* at the end of image insertion
     commands with per-buffer control (e.g., `\includegraphics{FILE}'
     in LaTeX, `<img src=FILE>' in HTML).  They show a scaled-down
     version of the included image files (using `convert' from
     ImageMagick (http://www.imagemagick.org/)).  A single mouse click
     on the image or command invokes the image editor for the
     corresponding image file.

   * It *does not* and *will not* provide commands to hide (more or
     less) uninteresting parts of your document or fontify them
     differently.  This is more the task of the corresponding major
     mode or `font-lock', e.g., `font-latex'.  (I admit, the support of
     super- and subscripts might let you think that this is a good
     point for the todo list of package X-Symbol.)  Using
     `outline-minor-mode' or folding might also be an alternative.

   If you prefer a more WYSIWYG-like document processor, you should
probably use `LyX' or `GNU TeXmacs'.  Here are some reasons why you
would use Emacs/XEmacs with package X-Symbol instead:

   * You have complete control over the LaTeX source.  X-Symbol supports
     more characters.

   * You can read any LaTeX source and you write normal LaTeX code,
     i.e., package X-Symbol does not use any special format.

   * It also supports HTML and TeXinfo documents and BibTeX entries.

   * You can use your favorite editor, i.e., Emacs or XEmacs.

About this Manual
=================

   Apart from this manual, there are two other sources of information
about X-Symbol:

   * The web pages of X-Symbol provide a summary of X-Symbol, including
     some screen shots.  You are strongly encouraged to read them
     carefully.  They probably provide enough info for the standard
     user and can be found at:

            `http://x-symbol.sourceforge.net/'

   * The online help for commands (functions) and user options
     (variables) is quite technical.  It is shown during customization
     and when using Emacs' Help menu.

   This manual is somewhere in between: it more detailed than the web
pages and less technical than the online help.  For example, when
explaining some functionality, it states the default behavior, gives an
impression of what can be customized, and it even lists all related
user options, but it does not describes the technical format of
possible values of each option.

   Section *Note X-Symbol Internals:: is for the curious reader and for
people who want to define their own token language.

   This manual does not explain Emacs in general or some optional
programs used by this package such as `convert' (used to produce the
image thumbnails).  It also includes no installation instructions for
those programs and the author of this package will not help you with the
installation of those programs (sorry for that).

   You do not have to learn this manual by heart before sending a
question to the maintainer of X-Symbol, but you should give the
impression that your really have tried to find the necessary
information yourself and spend some time making your report precise.
Before sending a problem report, please read *Note Bug Reports::.

Installation
************

   The short version of the installation instructions for package
X-Symbol on XEmacs is: uncompress & extract the *binary distribution* in
directory `~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages/', add `(x-symbol-initialize)' to
your `~/.emacs' and install ImageMagick for the image support (unless
you want to get a warning).

   Please check the web page *additionally* to the sections here for
the installation instructions for package X-Symbol on Emacs.

   The rest of this chapter contains the long version.  I recommend that
you read this chapter completely after a short test of X-Symbol,
especially if you have customized your Emacs more or less heavily or if
you get some problems.

Requirements
============

   This development version of package X-Symbol works with Emacs-21.1 or
higher, and XEmacs 20.4 or higher (XEmacs-21.1.9 is strongly
recommended, *Note FAQ XEmacs Core::), with or without Mule support.

   X-Symbol should work with all window systems Emacs is running under
(Mac is not testet and might not work).  Under X, no restrictions apply.
Under Windows with Emacs, images will not be displayed (they are not yet
supported by Emacs under Windows).  Under Windows with XEmacs, X-Symbol
just supports a limited number of characters (Latin-1, Latin-5, and half
the math symbols) and no super- and subscripts, due to missing
MS-Windows fonts (*note Wishlist Fonts::.).  Under a character terminal,
X-Symbol just supports Latin-1 characters only, no super- and subscripts
and no images.

   This package require package `font-lock' (distributed with Emacs and
XEmacs), the use of package `lazy-shot' is recommended, see *Note
Syntax Hiliting Packages::.

   If you want to see the images at the end of image insertion commands,
install `convert' from ImageMagick (http://www.imagemagick.org/), see
*Note Installing Image Converter::.  They show a scaled-down version of
the included image files.

   If you want to produce the Info files yourself (they are included in
the binary distribution), you need `makeinfo', Version 1.68 or higher.
If you want to produce a PS file from the manual, you need `texi2dvi'.
If you want to produce an HTML version of this manual, you need
`texi2html', Version 1.62 or higher.  *Note Installing Manual::.

Put the Files into your Home Directory
======================================

   If you use Emacs, please check the
web pages of X-Symbol (http://x-symbol.sourceforge.net/news.html).

   In this section, we assume that you want to install the binary
distribution (also called the binary tarball) of package X-Symbol in
your home directory.  To install it somewhere below the XEmacs root (it
might be already there), see *Note System-wide Installation::.  If you
use the source distribution, you should know what do to instead.

   In directory `~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages/', run
     zcat x-symbol-pkg.tar.gz | tar xvf -

   Remember that `tar' does not overwrite write-protected files.

   X-Symbol's `pcf' files and font directory must be world-readable
since you do not own the X11 font server process.  You are on the safe
side, if you run
     chmod -R a+rx ~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages

   If package X-Symbol has been installed system-wide and you install a
newer version in your `~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages/', you get a warning
during XEmacs' startup (autoload error: already loaded).  You can
safely ignore this warning, but there is unfortunately no good way to
get rid of it.  Yes, XEmacs' packaging system is excellent, but there
is still a place for improvements....

   Before XEmacs-21.0: the user package directory was `~/.xemacs/'
instead of `~/.xemacs/packages/'; also: delete and recompile the `.elc'
files.

System-wide Installation: Put the Files into the XEmacs Directory
=================================================================

   You can skip this section if your have installed X-Symbol in your
home directory according to the previous section.

   If you install package X-Symbol system-wide, use `default.el' and
`XEMACS/site-packages/' whenever `~/.emacs' and
`~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages/' are mentioned in the previous or following
subsections.  `XEMACS/site-packages/' is the directory of independent
packages for XEmacs.

   Under XEmacs-21, you can uncompress and extract the tarball by

     M-x package-admin-add-binary-package <RET> DIR/x-symbol-pkg.tar.gz

   Then, `XEMACS/' is the default directory of buffer `*Package
Output*' (use `C-x C-f' in that buffer to see it).  It might be
`/usr/local/lib/xemacs/xemacs-packages/' (the first element in variable
`late-packages').

   Under XEmacs-20, `XEMACS/' might be
`/usr/local/lib/xemacs-VERSION/'.  Here, you have to uncompress and
extract the tarball as described in *Note Installing Files::.  You also
have to load the autoload file explicitly by putting the following line
into file `site-start.el':

     (load "XEMACS/lisp/x-symbol/auto-autoloads")

   I would appreciate if you would set the following variables:

`x-symbol-installer-address'
     Please set this variable to your email address to catch problems
     which could be solved locally.  In your private `~/.emacs', you
     might want to set this variable to `nil'.

`x-symbol-package-url'
     If you have a local copy of the web pages (*note Installing
     Manual::.), set this variable to the corresponding URL.

Make XEmacs Initialize X-Symbol During Startup
==============================================

   Put the following into your `~/.emacs' (or `~/.xemacs/init.el'):

     (x-symbol-initialize)

   Basically, that's it!  If your XEmacs runs on a different machine,
check *Note Installing Fonts::.

   If you get a warning about X-Symbol not being able to deduce a
default encoding (or about limited support with XEmacs under Windows or
a character terminal, *Note Requirements::), set the default coding
(*note Default Coding::.) by putting the following in front of the line
above:

     (setq x-symbol-default-coding 'iso-8859-1)

   When running Emacs under a character terminal, you might need to use
the following (with or without X-Symbol):

     (unless window-system (standard-display-european 1))

   If your character terminal does not support Latin characters, there
is no reason to use package X-Symbol.  In this case, use the following
instead:

     (when window-system (x-symbol-initialize))

   The initialization can be controlled by the following variable:

`x-symbol-initialize'
     By default, package X-Symbol does a full initialization.  This
     includes an integration with some packages, see also *Note Package
     Integration::.

   If you use a B/W monitor and XEmacs/no-Mule, it might be necessary to
remove the font properties of any face which is used on regions with
X-Symbol characters: `isearch', `highlight', `primary-selection',
`secondary-selection', `paren-match', `paren-mismatch',
`paren-blink-off', `underline'.  I.e., for each FACE, use:

     (remove-specifier (get (get-face 'FACE) 'font))

Installing the Image Converter from ImageMagick
===============================================

   Program `convert' from ImageMagick is used to display images at the
end of image insertion commands.  The images show a scaled-down version
of the included image files.

   While the installation of `convert' is optional, you get a warning
if `convert' is not found on your system or if there is no image format
supported by both `convert' and Emacs.  Set variable
`x-symbol-image-converter' to `nil' if you don't want to get the
warning.

   On Unix, `convert' must be in your `$PATH'.  On Windows, it is
assumed to be found at `C:\ImageMagick\convert'.  If this is not the
case, you have to customize the variable
`x-symbol-image-convert-program'.

   Check `http://www.imagemagick.org/' for the installation
instructions.  Run `convert -h' and `convert -list Format' (in newer
versions of ImageMagick) in your shell to check whether the
installation of ImageMagick was successful.  If you have problems, check
the ImageMagick web page for FAQs and mailing lists.

   If you do not have a truecolor device (i.e., just 256 colors),
package X-Symbol uses `convert' with a colormap by default (*note Image
Conversion::.).  You might create and use your own colormap instead.  It
should be tuned to include the colors you use in Emacs anyway, i.e., the
face colors.

Package Integration
===================

   You might skip this section when trying package X-Symbol the first
time.  Nevertheless, I strongly recommend to read this section if you
have customized your Emacs more or less heavily or if you get some
problems.

   Some features of X-Symbol work by hooking itself into existing
functions of Emacs or related packages via predefined hooks.  A
potential problem arises if your customization or other packages use
the same hooks, or if other packages assume these hooks not to be used,
e.g., some packages assume the buffer contents to contain the same
characters as the corresponding file.

   This section lists some special adaptation for other packages
(everything is fine if you do not use these packages).  It also lists
potential problems in combination with other packages.  If you discover
some problems in combination with other packages, please let me know.

LaTeX Packages
--------------

   Objectives: relate positions in buffer to positions in file, do
conversion in master/slave buffers, preserve highlighting, improve input
methods and other things.

`auctex'
     Use Version 9.9c or higher, which includes `texmathp'.  There is
     some special X-Symbol adaptation for AucTeX:

        - X-Symbol supports AucTeX's multifile documents: it respects
          the variable `TeX-master' when searching for the file encoding
          (*note File Coding::.) and when converting image files with
          relative names (*note Image Display::.).

        - X-Symbol supports AucTeX's region commands: it ensures that
          characters in `_region_.tex' buffer are converted according
          to the parent buffer.  Initialization changes
          `TeX-region-hook'.  Requires AucTeX, v9.8a or higher.

        - X-Symbol's input method Electric (*note Input Method
          Electric::.) with token language `tex' uses package
          `texmathp'.

        - AucTeX's math mode commands also inserts X-Symbol characters
          (*note Mathematics: (auctex)Mathematics.).  Initialization
          sets `LaTeX-math-insert-function'.  Requires AucTeX, v9.8a or
          higher.

        - If TeX displays an error message, it also displays the
          context of the error position.  AucTeX uses the context to
          set point to this position when `M-x TeX-next-error' is
          invoked.  The former context are characters in the file, the
          latter characters in the buffer, X-Symbol provides the
          translation.  Initialization changes
          `TeX-translate-location-hook'.

`bib-cite'
     Use Version 3.0 or higher.  Initialization of package X-Symbol
     changes the installation of package bib-cite to make X-Symbol's
     decoding not overwrite `bib-cite's highlighting of `\cite' and
     friends.

`preview-latex'
     TeX's error positions are also used by package `preview-latex',
     which was clever enough to reuse the above mentioned hook of
     AucTeX.  Unfortunately, that hook is ... and does not allow a fast
     translation of error positions, so `preview-latex' allows to
     provide better variants of functions in that hook.  X-Symbol's
     variant is `x-symbol-tex-preview-locations'.

`reftex'
     Use Version 3.26 or higher.  For a workaround for some minor
     annoyances with the combination RefTeX/X-Symbol/Multifile
     Document, see *Note Problems and Work-arounds: (reftex)Problems
     and Work-arounds.  By default, the initialization of package
     X-Symbol makes RefTeX's label creation use the nicer Asciification
     of package X-Symbol (*note Ascii Representation::.) by setting
     `reftex-translate-to-ascii-function'.

`whizzytex'
     Use the newest.

Syntax Highlighting Packages (`font-lock' and add-ons)
------------------------------------------------------

   Objectives: start highlighting after conversion.  Highlighting is
needed for super- and subscripts and when using XEmacs without Mule
support.

`fast-lock'
     I recommend to use package `lazy-shot' instead.  By default, the
     initialization of package X-Symbol sets `fast-lock-save-faces' to
     `nil' to make package `fast-lock' work with X-Symbol.

`font-latex'
     I suggest to set `font-lock-maximum-decoration' to value `t', 2 or
     higher if you do not want to use super- and subscripts in arguments
     of `\label' and friends.  *Note FAQ Stupid Subscripts::.

`font-lock'
     Is required by this package (*note Role of font-lock::.).  I
     strongly recommend *not* to turn on font-lock in *any* mode hook,
     set `font-lock-auto-fontify' to `t' instead (this is the default,
     anyway).  See also `lazy-shot'.

     If you turn on font-lock in a mode-hook, visiting a file would
     become slower, since X-Symbol mode is usually turned on *after* the
     functions in the mode hook have been run, i.e., the fontification
     is getting useless if the tokens are automatically decoded.

`lazy-lock'
     From XEmacs-20.3 on, the successor is called `lazy-shot'.

`lazy-shot'
     Is strongly recommended.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: File IO Packages,  Next: Miscellaneous Packages,  Prev: Syntax Hiliting Packages,  Up: Package Integration

File I/O Packages
-----------------

   Issue: compression, encryption and so on can be seen as some kind of
conversion.  When doing multiple conversion, the sequence matters.

`ange-ftp'
     See also `efs' and `jka-compr'.

`comint'
     The default installation makes `comint's in-/output use X-Symbol's
     conversion function.  If you set variable `comint-input-sender',
     set it before initializing package X-Symbol.

`crypt'
`crypt++'
     I recommend to use package `jka-compr' instead.  *Note Spurious
     Encodings::.  *Note No Encoding::.  If you use `crypt' or
     `crypt++' and the character `alpha' looks like `\233a' after
     `save-buffer', set this variable to `slowest'.  *Note Open
     Questions::.

`efs'
     XEmacs' version of `ange-ftp'.  See also `jka-compr'.

`iso-cvt'
     There is no need to use it.  Package X-Symbol already provides the
     conversion between Latin-1 characters and "TeX macros".  Package
     X-Symbol does not provide the German and Spanish conversion tables,
     though.

`iso-sgml'
     There is no need to use it.  Package X-Symbol already provides the
     conversion between Latin-1 characters and "SGML entities".  *Note
     Miscellaneous Packages::, package `psgml-html'.

`jka-compr'
     Can be used with package X-Symbol, preferred to `crypt'.  The
     following is absolutely necessary (with or without using package
     X-Symbol, at least in older Emacsen): load `jka-compr' after
     `efs'/`ange-ftp'!

`latin-unity'
     Can be used with package X-Symbol, functionality is already
     provided by X-Symbol for Latin-{1,2,3,5,9} characters: remapping
     (*note Char Aliases::.) and recoding (*note File Coding::.).  Has
     some safe-encoding mechanism, but the test comes currently too
     early (*note Wishlist Emacs::.).

`vc'
     If you use package `crypt', `vc-next-action' and friends encode
     characters to tokens.  *Note Spurious Encodings::.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Miscellaneous Packages,  Prev: File IO Packages,  Up: Package Integration

Miscellaneous Packages
----------------------

`abbrev'
     On XEmacs without Mule support, I recommend to set variable
     `words-include-escapes' to `t'.  *Note Nomule Problems::.

`completion'
     Should work with X-Symbol (earlier version of X-Symbol had
     problems with input method token).

`desktop'
     XEmacs' version (an old one) does not save its `.emacs.desktop'
     files with a coding system.  Emacs' version save it with an
     incorrect coding system.  Thus, strings which contain X-Symbol's
     private characters might get corrupted.  See also package
     `session' below.

`flyspell'
     Should work apart from the general problem of `ispell'.

`func-menu'
     Should work with X-Symbol.

`ispell'
     The package `ispell' assumes the buffer contents to be the same as
     the file contents and does not provide any hook to fix this.  This
     should be fixed in `ispell', *Note Wishlist Emacs::.  *Note FAQ
     Spell Check::.

     Use a future version (hopefully v3.4).  Includes special X-Symbol
     initialization/handling and defines additional token languages.
     *Note External Languages::.

`psgml-html'
     `psgml-html': Do not set `html-auto-sgml-entity-conversion' to
     non-`nil'.  *Note File IO Packages::, package `iso-sgml'.

`session'
     Use Version 1.5a or higher.  If strings in this file should always
     be read correctly, you should put `(x-symbol-init-input)' into your
     `~/.emacs'; otherwise strings containing X-Symbol's private
     characters read from the `~/.session' file might look funny.  See
     also package `desktop' above.

`x-compose'
     All characters from `x-compose' are also supported by package
     X-Symbol.  Thus, I recommend to use `<multi-key>' instead `C-='
     when running under XEmacs without Mule support.  *Note Introducing
     Input Methods::.

Installing Additional Fonts
===========================

   You don't have to install X-Symbol fonts in usual circumstances (with
the binary distribution, Emacs runs on the same machine, you are happy
with the default fonts).

   If your Emacs runs on a different machine, please follow the steps 5
and 6 below or read the next section.

   If you want to install additional fonts (since the binary
distribution contains only a limited selection of fonts and font
sizes), please follow the following sequence which worked for me (on
SunOS 5.4-5.6/Solaris).  If you have to do s.th. (completely) different
on your system, please let me know--I will include your hints.

   If you are lost with the following instructions, use the standard
fonts from the binary distribution.  (Sorry, I do not have to time to
answer general Unix font questions.  Or to be more exact, I'm not an
expert in this area....  Nevertheless, if you have a clearer
explanation for the installation sequence below, please send me a patch
to `man/x-symbol/x-symbol.texi'.)

  1. Find the font which you want to replace by checking fonts with the
     X11 program `xfontsel' or `xfd'.  The bad news is that there is no
     general way to say which character belongs to which font.  My only
     goal was to use standard fonts whenever possible; the rest belong
     the the xsymb1 font (which I have designed).  If you want to use a
     font as an alternative to another font, it must have the same
     charset registry-encoding.

  2. Find the `.bdf' files of your preferred fonts in your file system
     or by Internet search engines like Google.  The source
     distribution of package X-Symbol contains `.bdf' files for
     additional fonts sizes of all fonts except the xsymb1 font (*note
     Wishlist Fonts::.).

     There are two categories of `.bdf' files.  The first category
     contains files for fonts which are already installed; the files are
     needed to create and install the super- and subscript versions.
     Copy these files to
     `~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages/etc/x-symbol/origfonts/'.  The second
     category contains files for fonts which are not installed.  Copy
     these files to `~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages/etc/x-symbol/fonts/'.

  3. In file `~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages/etc/x-symbol/fonts/Makefile',
     change variables `ORIGBDFS' for the first category and `BDFS' for
     the second category accordingly.

  4. In directory `~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages/etc/x-symbol/fonts/',
     execute `make mkdirs', and `make pcfs'.  You need GNUs `make' and
     `perl', Version 5 (or higher).

  5. If your Emacs runs on a different machine or if you want to use the
     fonts outside Emacs, too, add X-Symbol's fonts to your font path by
     inserting the following in your `~/.xsession' (X11 startup file).

          xset +fp ~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages/etc/x-symbol/pcf/

     For a system-wide installation, you might want to add this
     directory to the system-wide font path instead.

     If your system doesn't have `xset', you should copy all `.pcf'
     files (compiled fonts) from
     `~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages/etc/x-symbol/pcf/' into directory
     `/usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/' (Slackware distribution) and run
     `mkfontdir 75dpi' in that directory.

  6. Your are on the safe side if you restart X11 after this.

  7. Set the Emacs Lisp variables which define the fonts.  *Note
     Installing Fonts Lisp::.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Installing Fonts Exceed,  Next: Installing Fonts Lisp,  Prev: Installing Fonts,  Up: Installation

Installing Fonts for Exceed (X-server on Windows)
=================================================

   If your X-server on Windows is Exceed and if you have configured
Exceed to use the "native window manager" for your Unix screens, you
must install the X-Symbol fonts on Windows.  The following works with
Exceed 6.0 & NT 4.0 and Exceed 7.0 & Windows 2000:

  1. In Unix, edit file
     `~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages/etc/x-symbol/fonts/makesub' to limit
     the shift for superscript to 3 points:
          %supoffs = ('08',3, 10,3, 12,3, 14,3, 16,3, 18,3, 24,3);

  2. Then, execute `make mkdirs', and `make gens' in
     `~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages/etc/x-symbol/fonts/'.  If you have
     problems, please read the previous section.

  3. In Exceed's configuration window, click on <Font> to open Window
     `Font Settings'.  In this window, click on <Select All>, then on
     <Compile Fonts...>.

  4. Copy X-Symbol's `bdf' files in
     `~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages/etc/x-symbol/fonts/' and
     `~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages/etc/x-symbol/genfonts/' to a Windows
     directory and select this directory in the Exceed Window `Compile
     Fonts'.  Click on <Compile>.

  5. In Window `Font Settings', click on <Font Database...>.  In this
     window, click on <Add...>.  Enter the output directory from the
     previous step as the `Font Directory' and `xsymb' as the `File
     Name (*.fdb)'.  Click on <OK>.

  6. You might want to rearrange the sequence of Font DB files to let
     files `75dpi' appear prior to files `100dpi', because X-Symbol's
     fonts are designed for 75dpi.

  7. In Window `Font Database', click on <Rebuild Database...> and then
     on <OK>.

   Note: *Windows NT 4.0 will crash (bluescreen) if you use fonts
compiled by Exceed from the `pcf' files or if you missed step 1, i.e.,
limiting the superscript shift!*  With Exceed 7.0 & Windows 2000, there
is no crash, but these fonts cannot be displayed.

   If you use XEmacs with Exceed as your X-server on Windows, X-Symbol
cannot warn you about undefined fonts, because XEmacs in general cannot
recognizes in that case, whether a font exists.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Installing Fonts Lisp,  Next: Installing Manual,  Prev: Installing Fonts Exceed,  Up: Installation

Lisp Coding when Using Other Fonts
==================================

   Package X-Symbol needs to know which fonts to use for the X-Symbol
characters and super- and subscripts.  It also must interact with
package `font-lock' to display them (*note Role of font-lock::.).

   If you have installed additional fonts (*note Installing Fonts::.)
for use with package X-Symbol, you might have to change the following
variables:

`x-symbol-latin1-fonts'
`x-symbol-latin2-fonts'
`x-symbol-latin3-fonts'
`x-symbol-latin5-fonts'
`x-symbol-latin9-fonts'
`x-symbol-xsymb0-fonts'
`x-symbol-xsymb1-fonts'
     The value of each variable consists of three elements: one for the
     normal text, one for subscripts and one for the superscripts.  Each
     element is a list of fonts which are tried in order--the first
     which exists on your system is used.

     If you change the values of one of these variables, do only
     specify the same charset registry-encoding (e.g.,
     `adobe-fontspecific') as specified by the fonts in the default
     value of this variable.

`x-symbol-font-sizes'
     Here you can specify the sizes for all fonts in the above mentioned
     variables.  The value consists of regular expressions matching font
     names and numbers which replace all occurences of `%d' in the
     names.

   E.g., if you prefer larger fonts, you might want to insert the
following into your `~/.emacs':

     (setq x-symbol-font-sizes
       '(18 ("_su[bp]-" . 14) ("\\`-etl-" . 16)))
     (setq x-symbol-xsymb0-fonts
       '(("-adobe-symbol-medium-r-normal-*-*-%d0-*-*-*-*-adobe-fontspecific"
          "-xsymb-xsymb0-medium-r-normal--%d-%d0-75-75-p-85-adobe-fontspecific")
         ("-adobe-symbol_sub-medium-r-normal-*-*-%d0-*-*-*-*-adobe-fontspecific"
          "-xsymb-xsymb0_sub-medium-r-normal--%d-%d0-75-75-p-74-adobe-fontspecific")
         ("-adobe-symbol_sup-medium-r-normal-*-*-%d0-*-*-*-*-adobe-fontspecific"
          "-xsymb-xsymb0_sup-medium-r-normal--%d-%d0-75-75-p-74-adobe-fontspecific")))

   The first assignment changes the font sizes, the second makes
X-Symbol using the original Adobe symbol font instead of my minor
modification (appearance) of it.  The xsymb1 font will be scaled, which
might not look nice (*note FAQ Font Size::.).

   You might want to change the following variables:

`x-symbol-latin-force-use'
     Package X-Symbol defines Latin characters even when the
     corresponding fonts are missing (this can be changed by this
     variable).  Characters for the symbol fonts are only defined if
     the corresponding fonts are available.

`x-symbol-mule-change-default-face'
     Package X-Symbol does not change the fonts of pre-defined Mule
     charsets (this can be changed by this variable).  Thus, the
     variables from Section *Note Installing Fonts Lisp:: might have no
     influence if Emacs already has defined fonts for the corresponding
     charsets.

Installing Info, Postscript and HTML Files
==========================================

   To create the info files, execute `make info' in directory
`~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages/man/x-symbol/' of the distribution.  It
requires `makeinfo', Version 1.68 or higher.  This should not be
necessary if you use the binary distribution of package X-Symbol.

   If no entry for X-Symbol is automatically added to the info directory
listing, add the following line to `~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages/info/dir':
     * X-Symbol::	 Semi WYSIWYG for LaTeX, HTML and other "token languages"

   Optionally, you might want to create a printed document from the
TeXinfo file.  Execute `make ps' in directory
`~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages/man/x-symbol/' of the distribution.  It
requires `texi2dvi'.

   Optionally, you can create an online manual for a web browser by
executing `make html' in directory
`~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages/man/x-symbol/' of the distribution.  It
requires `texi2html'.

   All formats of the manual are created by executing `make all'.

Checking the Correct Installation of Package X-Symbol
=====================================================

   After having completed the installation, exit and restart Emacs.

   * Type `M-x show-message-log' to check whether you got problems so
     far, e.g., whether errors occurred when loading a file.  If you do,
     identity and correct the offender.

   * Type `M-x x-symbol-grid' in buffer `*scratch*'.  If you get the
     Grid but if you see less characters than you see on the web page of
     package X-Symbol, you have decided to use other fonts but failed to
     install them correctly.  This is also mentioned in buffer
     `*Warnings*'.  *Note Installing Fonts::.

   * Move your mouse pointer to any X-Symbol character in buffer

Token Language
==============

   As mentioned in the overview, "X-Symbol Characters" in the buffer are
represented by "tokens" in the file.  The correspondence between these
is determined by the "token language" which is in close relation to the
major mode of the current buffer.  E.g., character `alpha' stands for
`\alpha' in LaTeX buffers.

   For details of predefined token languages "TeX macro" (`tex'), "SGML
entity" (`sgml'), "BibTeX macro" (`bib'), and "TeXinfo command"
(`texi'), see *Note Supported Languages::.

   The token language determines the conversion between X-Symbol
characters and tokens (*Note Conversion::), the input methods (*note
Input Methods::.), and various other features (*note Features::.).

   The token language is defined by the following buffer-local variable:

`x-symbol-language'
     Token language used in current buffer.  You can set this variable
     in the "local variables list" near the end of the file (*note File
     Variables: (xemacs)File Variables.), e.g.:

          %% Local Variables:
          %% x-symbol-language: tex
          %% End:

   Package X-Symbol uses a reasonable value according to the major mode
and the file name of a buffer if the variable is not already
buffer-local.  A valid token language is required to turn on X-Symbol
Minor mode, see *Note Minor Mode::.

   A token language must be "registered", if you want to use it.  By
default, the above mentioned token languages are registered.

Conversion: Decoding and Encoding
=================================

   As mentioned, X-Symbol characters in the buffer are represented by
tokens in the file.  Thus, we need some conversion from tokens to
characters, called "decoding", and some conversion from characters to
tokens, called "encoding".

   We have the additional problem that some characters are not only
represented by tokens, but also via some 8bit character encoding.

   Package X-Symbol supports the following 8bit character encodings:
Latin-1 (`iso-8859-1'), Latin-2 (`iso-8859-2'), Latin-3 (`iso-8859-3'),
Latin-5 (`iso-8859-9'), and Latin-9 (`iso-8859-15').  It currently
supports less encodings with XEmacs on Windows (*note Requirements::.).

* Menu:

File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Default Coding,  Next: File Coding,  Prev: Conversion,  Up: Conversion

Normal File and Default Encoding
--------------------------------

   As mentioned, some characters have a 8bit file encoding, and X-Symbol
needs to know which 8bit file encoding you use normally when visiting a
file and saving a buffer.

   With Mule support, Emacs/XEmacs can recognize the "normal file
encoding", also called a coding system (*note Recognize Coding:
(xemacs)Recognize Coding.).

   Without Mule support, XEmacs can usually only support 8bit
characters of one encoding; this encoding corresponds to the
charset/registry of your default font.  Here, the "normal file
encoding" is the default encoding:

`x-symbol-default-coding'
     The default encoding.  The value must be a symbol denoting one of
     the supported encodings or `nil'.  The variable must be set before
     X-Symbol has been initialized.  *Note Installing Lisp::.

   The "default encoding" is not only used to determine the normal file
encoding without Mule, but also for the following:

   * X-Symbol has its own mechanism to recognize a file encoding which
     only works with a specified default encoding.  *Note File Coding::.

   * The same character can be included in various Latin charsets and
     X-Symbol needs to know which of the instances (which Emacs views as
     different characters) to support.  *Note Char Aliases::.

   * Without Mule support, the default encoding is also needed to decide
     which characters have to be faked by 2 characters internally:
     exactly the characters in those charsets which do not correspond
     to the default encoding.  *Note Poor Mans Mule::.

   To deduce the default value, X-Symbol inspects the Mule language
environment and the output of the shell command `locale', or to be more
exact:

     locale -ck code_set_name charmap

   Without Mule support, you get a warning if the command does not
exist on your system or lists an encoding which is not supported by
X-Symbol, such as some Asian encoding.  Value `nil' is the same as
`iso-8859-1'.

   With Mule support, you get a warning if the command lists a supported
encoding which is different from the encoding deduced from the Mule
language environment.  Value `nil' makes sure that X-Symbol file
encoding detection (*note File Coding::.) only works if Emacs has
detected the same encoding; it works like `iso-8859-1' otherwise.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: File Coding,  Next: Controlling 8bit Coding,  Prev: Default Coding,  Up: Conversion

File Coding of 8bit Characters
------------------------------

   X-Symbol can use a different encoding for single buffers/files, even
if you use X-Symbol on XEmacs without Mule support.  To do so, set the
following buffer-local variable:

`x-symbol-coding'
     8bit character encoding in the file visited by the current buffer.
     Value `nil' represents the normal file encoding (*note Default
     Coding::.).

     With Mule support, any value other than `nil' is considered invalid
     if the normal file encoding is neither the same as this value nor
     the same as the default encoding.  I.e., if your default encoding
     is `nil', X-Symbol's file encoding detection never takes precedence
     over Emacs' one, i.e., the normal file encoding.

     You can set this variable in the "local variables list" near the
     end of the file (*note File Variables: (xemacs)File Variables.),
     e.g.:

          <!-- Local Variables: -->
          <!-- x-symbol-coding: iso-8859-2 -->
          <!-- End: -->

   If the variable is not already buffer-local, a reasonable value is
deduced when turning on X-Symbol (*note Minor Mode::.) by searching for
some language dependent headers at the beginning of the file:

`x-symbol-auto-coding-search-limit'
     X-Symbol usually searches for something like
     `\usepackage[...]{inputenc}' (*note TeX Macro::.) or `<meta ...
     charset=...>' (*note SGML Entity::.) in the first 10000 characters.

   If you choose not to save a file containing 8bit characters (*note
Controlling 8bit Coding::.), the file encoding is still important,
since the file might contain 8bit characters when you visit it.

   If the file encoding is different to the normal file encoding,
X-Symbol performs the necessary recoding itself.  "Recoding" changes a
character with code position POS in one charset to a character with the
same code position POS in another charset.  If the normal file encoding
is different to the default encoding, X-Symbol also resolves character
aliases (*note Char Aliases::.).

   If you have specified an invalid file encoding (including an encoding
different to a non-default normal file encoding), we have the following
cases:

   * If the normal file encoding is unsupported (any file encoding is
     invalid in this case) or if the normal file encoding is supported
     and the file does not contain 8bit characters, we always encode
     all X-Symbol character (*Note Controlling 8bit Coding::).  The
     modeline includes `-i' to represent the file encoding (*note Minor
     Mode::.), except if the default encoding is `nil', the normal file
     encoding is unsupported, and the variable `x-symbol-coding' is not
     specified.

   * If the normal file encoding is supported and the file contains at
     least one 8bit character, X-Symbol does not touch 8bit characters
     and never produces them, neither via decoding (*note Unique
     Decoding::.) nor via input methods.  The modeline includes `-err'
     to represent the file encoding (*note Minor Mode::.).

   We end with a little example: if your normal file encoding and
default encoding is Latin-1, and you visit a file with
`\usepackage[latin9]{inputenc}' producing some document containing the
Euro sign, you see the Euro character in Emacs when X-Symbol is
enabled, but you see the currency character without X-Symbol.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Controlling 8bit Coding,  Next: Unique Decoding,  Prev: File Coding,  Up: Conversion

Store or Encode 8bit Characters
-------------------------------

   You can specify that 8bit characters (according to the coding in your
file, *Note File Coding::), are not encoded to tokens (when saving a
file), by setting the following buffer-local variable:

`x-symbol-8bits'
     Whether to store 8bit characters when saving the current buffer.

     You can set this variable in the "local variables list" near the
     end of the file (*note File Variables: (xemacs)File Variables.),
     e.g.:

          %% Local Variables:
          %% x-symbol-8bits: t
          %% End:

   If the variable is not already buffer-local, a reasonable value is
deduced when turning on X-Symbol (*note Minor Mode::.) by setting it the
the value of `x-symbol-coding', or searching in the file for 8bit
characters:

`x-symbol-auto-8bit-search-limit'
     If there is a 8bit character in the file when visiting it,
     X-Symbol will also store 8bit characters when saving the buffer.

   If the file encoding is invalid (*note File Coding::.), we always
search for 8bit characters in the complete document and set
`x-symbol-8bits' accordingly.  Then, a non-`nil' value also implies
unique decoding (*note Unique Decoding::.).

   While the variable `x-symbol-8bits' usually only influences the
encoding, it also influences the decoding if you choose to decode
uniquely (*note Unique Decoding::.).

   Setting variable `x-symbol-8bits' to `nil' does not necessarily mean
that the file will not contain 8bit characters: the characters might
have no token representation in the current token language (*note
TeXinfo Command::.), or they are glyphs for ununsed code points in the
Latin-3 charset.  In both cases, it is unlikely that you have inserted
these invalid characters via X-Symbol's input methods (*note
Introducing Input Methods::.), you have probably copied them into the
current buffer.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Unique Decoding,  Next: Conversion Commands,  Prev: Controlling 8bit Coding,  Up: Conversion

Unique Decoding
---------------

   Token languages might define more than one token representing the
same character.  When decoding and encoding these tokens, they will be
"normalized" to one form, the "canonical representation".  E.g., with
language `tex', visiting a file with tokens `\neq' and `\ne' converts
both tokens to character `lessequal', saving the buffer stores the
character as token `\neq' in both occurrences.

   It can also happen that a file contains both a 8bit character and a
token which would be converted to exactly that character.  When saving
the file, both characters are either not encoded, or both are encoded to
the same token.

   Normally, this is no problem.  But if you redefine standard TeX
macros, it certainly could be the case (*note TeX Macro Problems::.)!
For this reason, package X-Symbol provides the following buffer-local
variable:

`x-symbol-unique'
     Whether to limit the decoding in such a way that no normalization
     will happen.  That means: only decode canonical tokens, and, if
     `x-symbol-8bits' is non-`nil' (*note Controlling 8bit Coding::.),
     do not decode tokens which would be decoded to 8bit characters
     (according to the coding in your file, *Note File Coding::).

     You can set this variable in the "local variables list" near the
     end of the file (*note File Variables: (xemacs)File Variables.),
     e.g., together with a setting for `x-symbol-8bits':

          %% Local Variables:
          %% x-symbol-8bits: t
          %% x-symbol-unique: t
          %% End:

   If the variable is not already buffer-local, a reasonable value is
deduced when turning on X-Symbol (*note Minor Mode::.): it will be set
to `t' if X-Symbol mode is not automatically turned on.

   If the file encoding is invalid (*note File Coding::.) and
`x-symbol-8bits' is non-`nil' (*note Controlling 8bit Coding::.),
X-Symbol always uses unique decoding (*note Unique Decoding::.).


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Conversion Commands,  Next: Copy with Conversion,  Prev: Unique Decoding,  Up: Conversion

Conversion Commands
-------------------

   First the good news: most of the time, the necessary conversions are
performed automatically when you would expect them to be performed:

   * Turning X-Symbol minor mode (*note Minor Mode::.) on/off also
     performs decoding/encoding.

   * Saving a buffer where X-Symbol is enabled will encode the
     characters to tokens in the file (of course, you keep to have the
     characters in the buffer).

   * Inserting a file into a buffer where X-Symbol is enabled will
     decode the tokens in the inserted region.

   Nevertheless, you might want to perform the conversions explicitly in
some situations by using one of the following commands (also to be found
in the menu):

`M-x x-symbol-decode-recode'
     Recode all characters (if necessary) and decode all tokens to
     characters.

`M-x x-symbol-decode'
     Decode all tokens to characters, do not recode characters.

`M-x x-symbol-encode-recode'
     Encode all characters in buffer to tokens or recode them.

`M-x x-symbol-encode'
     Encode all characters in buffer to tokens.  No recoding will be
     performed since 8bit characters will always be encoded if the file
     coding is different to the default coding, since `x-symbol-8bits'
     is relative to the file coding, *Note Controlling 8bit Coding::.

   All commands work on the region if it is active, or the (narrowed
part of the) buffer if no region is active.

   If the file coding is the same as the default coding, the variants
with and without recoding (*note File Coding::.) do the same.  The
variants with recodings are the ones used when doing the conversion
automatically.  The variants without recodings are the ones used when
using the special Copy & Paste commands presented in the next
subsection.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Copy with Conversion,  Next: Char Aliases,  Prev: Conversion Commands,  Up: Conversion

Copy & Paste with Conversion
----------------------------

   You probably use X-Symbol, because you want to produce some
non-ASCII characters in your final document, but you are not really
interested what kind of token you would need to write.  (After all, you
do not use a hex editor to produce documents using some non-ASCII
encoding in the file, since you are not interested in the byte sequence
of individual characters.)

   Consequently, all editing operations really work on characters, not
on the corresponding tokens for the token language of the current
buffer.  This includes copying and pasting: if you copy the character
`plusminus' from a LaTeX buffer to a HTML buffer, you really copy that
character and not the three characters of the TeX macro `\pm'.

   If you copy text to a buffer where X-Symbol is not enabled, like a
mail buffer, that is probably not what you want.  Similarly, you would
probably like to see the X-Symbol characters for tokens in a text which
you have copied from such a buffer.  Therefore, X-Symbol provides the
following commands (also to be found in the menu):

`M-x x-symbol-copy-region-encoded'
     Save the region in the `kill-ring' with all X-Symbol characters
     encoded like by `M-x x-symbol-encode', i.e., without recoding.

`M-x x-symbol-yank-decoded'
     Reinsert the last text in the `kill-ring' and decode the inserted
     text like `M-x x-symbol-decode', i.e., without recoding.

   You could get the same result with the usual copy & paste commands
and the conversion commands from the previous section (*note Conversion
Commands::.), but this would clutter the undo information of the current
buffer and would require an additional undo operation for the copy.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Char Aliases,  Prev: Copy with Conversion,  Up: Conversion

Character Aliases
-----------------

   A "character alias" or "char alias" is a character which is also a
character in a font with another registry, e.g., `adiaeresis' is
defined in all supported Latin fonts.  Emacs distinguish between these
five characters.  In package X-Symbol, one of them, with
`x-symbol-default-coding' (*note Default Coding::. if possible, is
supported by the input methods, the other ones are char aliases to the
supported one.

   The reason is that it would be confusing for the user to choose among
different `adiaeresis'es and that there are neither different
`adiaeresis'es in Unicode nor in the token representations of languages
`tex' and `sgml'.

   8bit characters in files with a file coding `x-symbol-coding' other
than `x-symbol-default-coding' are converted to the "normal" form.
E.g., if you have a Latin-1 font by default, the `adiaeresis' in a
Latin-2 encoded file is a Latin-1 `adiaeresis' in the buffer.  When
saving the buffer, its is again the right 8bit character in the Latin-2
encoded file.

   Thus, in normal cases, buffers do not have char aliases.  In Emacs
with Mule support, this is only possible if you copy characters from
buffers with characters considered as char aliases by package X-Symbol,
e.g., from the Mule file `european.el'.  In XEmacs without Mule support,
this is only possible if you use commands like `C-q 2 3 4'.

   If you have char aliases in the current buffer, you might want to use
(it is not really necessary, just when searching for characters):

`M-x x-symbol-unalias'
     Resolve all character aliases in buffer.  If the region is active,
     only resolve char aliases in the region.

   A single char alias before point can be resolved by command
`x-symbol-modify-key' and `x-symbol-rotate-key', see *Note Input Method
Context::.

   The XEmacs package `latin-unity' provides a command to "remap"
characters to one character set (if possible).  X-Symbol's unaliasing
can be seen as remap operations to a fixed sequence of character sets.

Minor Mode
==========

   X-Symbol is a minor mode (*note Minor Modes: (xemacs)Minor Modes.)
which enables the features mentioned in this manual:

   * X-Symbol mode is required to do the conversions.  Turning the
     minor mode on/off also includes decoding/encoding (*note
     Conversion Commands::.).

   * X-Symbol mode provides the minor mode menu which includes: various
     commands, commands to insert characters (*note Input Method
     Menu::.), and entries to change some global and buffer-local
     variables mentioned in this manual.

   * X-Symbol mode is required for most input methods (*note Input
     Methods::.)  and other features (*note Features::.).

   With the default installation, X-Symbol mode is automatically turned
on when it is appropriate to do so (see below for details).  You can
control it for individually by the following command:

`M-x x-symbol-mode'
     Toggle X-Symbol mode.  If provided with a prefix argument, turn
     X-Symbol mode on if the numeric value of the argument is positive,
     else turn it off.  If no token language can be deduced, ask for a
     token language; if provided with a non-numeric prefix argument
     (`C-u M-x x-symbol-mode'), always ask.

     By default, X-Symbol mode is disabled in special major-modes
     visiting a file, e.g., `vm-mode' (*note FAQ News and Mail::.).
     Use a prefix argument to be asked whether to turn in on anyway.

   Turning X-Symbol mode on requires that you have a valid token
language for the current buffer.  Since turning X-Symbol mode on also
decodes tokens, it is also useful to set the variables which control the
conversion (*note Conversion::.).

   Since people usually do not want to write some Emacs Lisp functions
to do some customizations, X-Symbol provides the following variables
which induce X-Symbol to set the necessary buffer-local variables when
X-Symbol is turned on:

`x-symbol-auto-style-alist'
     You can use the major mode and/or the name of the buffer or visited
     file, and specific functions to set the following variables (if not
     already buffer-local):

        - `x-symbol-token-language' (*note Token Language::.),
          indicated in the modeline, e.g. `tex',

        - `x-symbol-mode', i.e., whether it is appropriate to turn on
          X-Symbol mode automatically,

        - `x-symbol-coding' (*note File Coding::.), indicated in the
          modeline if different from the default coding, e.g. `-l2' for
          Latin-2,

        - `x-symbol-8bits' (*note Controlling 8bit Coding::.),
          indicated in the modeline by `8',

        - `x-symbol-unique' (*note Unique Decoding::.), indicated in
          the modeline by `*',

        - `x-symbol-subscripts' (*note Super and Subscripts::.),
          indicated in the modeline by `s',

        - `x-symbol-image' (*note Images::.), indicated in the modeline
          by `i',

`x-symbol-LANG-modes'
     Major modes which use token language LANG by default.  *Note
     Supported Languages::.

`x-symbol-LANG-auto-style'
     Default values for the above mentioned variables `x-symbol-mode',
     `x-symbol-coding', `x-symbol-8bits', `x-symbol-unique',
     `x-symbol-subscripts', and `x-symbol-image' if not already
     buffer-local.

`x-symbol-auto-mode-suffixes'
     Regular expression matching file suffixes to be ignored when
     checking file names for the derivation above, e.g., extension
     `.orig'.

`x-symbol-modeline-state-list'
     This variable controls the modeline appearance just mentioned.

     The menu might also include individual entries for a token
     language (*note TeX Macro Basics::.):

`x-symbol-LANG-extra-menu-items'
     Extra menu items for each token language LANG (*note TeX Macro
     Basics::.).

Poor Man's Mule: Running Under XEmacs/no-Mule
=============================================

   Using XEmacs/no-Mule normally means that you are restricted to use
not more than 256 different characters in your documents.

   Package X-Symbol provides a lot more characters which can also be
used with XEmacs/no-Mule.  Internally, all X-Symbol characters except
the ones of your default font (*note Default Coding::.) are represented
by two characters, see *Note Char Representation::.

   This can lead to a lot of problems, which are resolved by the
following methods (some annoyances remain, *note Nomule Problems::.)
when X-Symbol mode is turned on (*note Minor Mode::.):

   * After each editing command, i.e., point movement, deletion of text
     and insertion of text, package X-Symbol checks whether just one of
     the two internal characters of an X-Symbol character has been
     affected.

   * Package `font-lock' is used to display these two-character
     sequences with the correct fonts.  The potential problem lies in
     the set-up of the corresponding font-lock keywords, see *Note Role
     of font-lock::.

    `x-symbol-nomule-fontify-cstrings'
          Alternatively to enabling `font-lock', you can run this
          functions in buffers having the special two-character
          sequences.  With the default installation, this function is
          run in the selection buffers of package `reftex'.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Role of font-lock,  Next: Char Group,  Prev: Poor Mans Mule,  Up: Concepts

The Role of `font-lock'
=======================

   Package X-Symbol uses package `font-lock' to display super- and
subscripts (*note Super and Subscripts::.) and to display its special
characters under XEmacs/no-Mule (*note Poor Mans Mule::.).  Thus, you
should enable `font-lock' in buffers where you want to use X-Symbol (it
is by default).  *Note Syntax Hiliting Packages::.

   When X-Symbol mode is turned on, it automatically adds the necessary
font-lock keywords to the buffer-local value of `font-lock-keywords'
and all font-lock keywords which are commonly used with the current
token language.

   Setting all font-lock keywords is important since `font-lock' might
not yet been turned on or since you might want to change `font-lock's
decoration of the current buffer after X-Symbol has been turned on.

   Please note that switching the mode by typing `M-x latex-mode' *does
not set* the LaTeX's font-lock keywords!  They are set at the end of
`C-x C-f'.  If you switch the mode, turn on `font-lock' by yourself.

   Independently from package X-Symbol, the following command might be
useful in some situations:

`M-x x-symbol-fontify'
     Refontify buffer.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Char Group,  Prev: Role of font-lock,  Up: Concepts

Character Group and Token Classes
=================================

   Each X-Symbol character belongs to a "character group", e.g.,
`natnums' belongs to `setsymbol'.  A character group should consists of
similar characters where "similar" means similar meaning, not similar
appearance.  Two characters which have nearly the same appearance,
should be in the same group, though.  The group determines:

   * The Grid and submenu header under which the character can be found
     (*note Input Method Grid::., *Note Input Method Menu::).

   * The default bindings of characters (*note Input Method
     Keyboard::.) of some groups.

   * Whether to show the context info for a character (*note Info::.).

   * The default ASCII representation of a character (*note Ascii
     Representation::.).

   * When using Emacs/XEmacs with Mule support, the syntax of a
     character (*note Syntax: (xemacs)Syntax.).

   The character group is independent from any token language, but is
probably somewhat related to some of its "token classes".  For each
token language, each character is assigned to a list of token classes,
which can be used for the following:

   * Information in the echo area (*note Info::.), it could inform
     users to include a specific LaTeX package when they want to use
     that character in the document.

   * Using a "coloring scheme" when displaying the characters in the
     echo area (*note Info::.) or the Grid of characters (*note Input
     Method Grid::.), useful for characters which can just be used in a
     specific context, like TeX's math-mode characters.

   * Restricting the "electricity" of input method Electric (*note
     Input Method Electric::.), useful to disable this input methods
     for TeX's math-mode characters if we are in text-mode.

X-Symbol's Input Methods
************************

   An X-Symbol "input method" is a way, provided by package X-Symbol,
to insert a X-Symbol character (not in the sense of Mule's "input
methods").  For a short overview with screenshots, see the
web pages of X-Symbol (http://x-symbol.sourceforge.net/details.html).

   Input methods Token and Electric change the normal way to insert
characters a bit.  Therefore, they require X-Symbol mode to be turned on
and can be turned off explicitly.  The other input methods are provided
with additional commands and key prefixes, they can also be used in
buffers where X-Symbol mode is turned off.

   With AucTeX, Version 9.8a or higher, its math mode commands also
inserts X-Symbol characters (*note Mathematics: (auctex)Mathematics.).

Common Behavior of All Input Methods
====================================

   Input methods normally just inserts "valid characters" which are
those characters which have a useful representation in the file:

`x-symbol-valid-charsym-function'
     When X-Symbol is turned off, a character is valid if it is an 8bit
     character according to the value of `x-symbol-default-coding'.

     When X-Symbol is turned on, a character is valid if the characters
     could be encoded to a token in language `x-symbol-language' (*note
     Token Language::.).

   If a buffer is read-only (*note Misc Buffer: (xemacs)Misc Buffer.),
most input methods push the character to insert onto the kill ring
instead.  Typing `C-y' lets you then insert the character (*note
Yanking: (xemacs)Yanking.).

   The input methods Keyboard, Menu and Grid (the character selection
with `<button2>') have the same interpretation of the prefix argument:

   * With prefix argument `0', do not insert anything, just barf, if the
     character is not valid.

   * With a positive prefix argument, insert a character that many
     times.  Barf, if the character is not valid.

   * With a negative prefix argument, insert a character as many times
     as specified by the absolute value of the prefix argument.  A
     character is also inserted if it is not valid.

   * With one or more `C-u's with no digits, insert the token of a
     language to choose, including "x-symbol charsym" (*note Pseudo
     Language::.).

   Many input commands of package X-Symbol uses the same key prefix in
its default binding:

`x-symbol-compose-key'
     By default, `C-=' is used as the key prefix.  Under XEmacs/no-Mule,
     you might want to use `<multi-key>' instead:

          (unless (featurep 'mule) (setq x-symbol-compose-key '(multi-key)))

`x-symbol-auto-key-autoload'
     Set this to `nil', if you do not want that pressing `C-='
     automatically initializes the input methods.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Input Method Token,  Next: Input Method Read Token,  Prev: Introducing Input Methods,  Up: Input Methods

Input Method Token: Replace Token by Character
==============================================

   If X-Symbol mode is on, input method "Token" automatically replaces
the token by the corresponding character when inserting the next
character following the token (in some token languages you need the next
character to decide whether the token is completed) if it is valid.

   The token will be replaced only if the next character has been
inserted without prefix argument or with prefix argument 0 (`C-u 0'),
the latter will therefore just induce the replacement.

   Please note that the token is really replaced by the characters, it
is not just `font-lock' which highlights the token to look like a
character.

   You might want to press `C-/' or `C-x u' to undo the replacement.
Input method Token requires X-Symbol mode to be enabled, it can be
disabled (and re-enabled) by setting the following variable:

`x-symbol-token-input'
     A boolean which can also be changed via the X-Symbol menu.

   Individual token language might slightly change the way input method
Token works exactly; from the predefined language, it is just `tex'
(*note TeX Macro::.).


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Input Method Read Token,  Next: Input Method Menu,  Prev: Input Method Token,  Up: Input Methods

Input Method Read Token: Minibuffer Completion
==============================================

   You can insert a character by reading the corresponding token in the
minibuffer.  You are offered completion over the known tokens (*note
Completion: (xemacs)Completion.).

`M-x x-symbol-read-token-direct'
`C-= <TAB>'
     Insert character by selecting a token in the current token language
     (even if X-Symbol mode is turned off) or an "x-symbol charsym"
     (*note Pseudo Language::.).

`M-x x-symbol-read-token'
`C-= <RET>'
     Insert character by first selecting the token language and then a
     token in that language.

   Input method Read Token also works if X-Symbol mode is not enabled.
It uses the common interpretation of prefix arguments for X-Symbol
insert commands, see *Note Introducing Input Methods::.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Input Method Menu,  Next: Input Method Grid,  Prev: Input Method Read Token,  Up: Input Methods

Input Method Menu: Select a Menu Item
=====================================

   If X-Symbol mode is turned on, a "Menu" `X-Symbol' appears in the
menubar (*note Minor Mode::.).  It also appears over non-highlighted
parts in the Grid and the Key Completions buffer (*note Input Method
Grid::.).  The menu allows to change buffer-local and global variables
(some directly, some via package `custom').  It has a submenu with the
most interesting commands of package X-Symbol.

   The menu has submenus with commands to insert X-Symbol characters.
The submenu headers are the same as the headers in the Grid, see *Note
Char Group::.  The appearance of the menu can be customized:

`x-symbol-local-menu'
     With a valid token language, the X-Symbol menu only contains
     insertion commands for valid characters.  The entries are
     mentioned and sorted according to the token.  Otherwise, the
     X-Symbol menu contains all characters, the entries are mentioned
     according to their charsym name.

`x-symbol-menu-max-items'
     The submenus do not contain more than 30 insertion commands for
     X-Symbol characters.  A submenu is split if necessarily.

   Input method Menu also works if X-Symbol mode is not enabled.  It
uses the common interpretation of prefix arguments for X-Symbol insert
commands, see *Note Introducing Input Methods::.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Input Method Grid,  Next: Input Method Keyboard,  Prev: Input Method Menu,  Up: Input Methods

Input Method Grid: Choose Highlighted Character
===============================================

   Probably the easiest way to insert a character is by using a "Grid"
of characters:

`M-x x-symbol-grid'
`C-= C-='
     Pops up a buffer displaying X-Symbol characters in a grid like
     fashion.  You can select a character with the mouse or `<RET>',
     see below.

   In the Grid buffer and the buffer with the possible completions for
an X-Symbol key sequence (*note Input Method Keyboard::.), the following
commands are used if the mouse pointer is over an highlighted character.

`<button2>'
`<RET>'
`<SPC>'
     Insert highlighted character (or character under point,
     respectively) into the buffer of `point' if `point' is not in the
     same buffer as the highlighted character.  Otherwise, insert the
     character into the reference buffer, i.e., the buffer where you
     have invoked the grid or the key completions from.  (The reference
     to the buffer is erased when an X-Symbol character is inserted
     into any buffer.)

`<button3>'
     Pops up a highlight menu where you can select to insert the token
     of various token languages instead the character itself.  In order
     not to load and initialize all additional token language you have
     not yet used, the menu offers to do so explicitly for supported
     (registered) token languages (*note Token Language::.).

   Over all non-highlighted parts, the following commands are used:

`<button2>'
     Scroll Grid or Key Completions buffer down in upper half of the
     window and scroll up in the lower half of the window.

`<button3>'
     Pops up the X-Symbol menu, *Note Input Method Menu::).

   When using the keyboard to select a character, the following command
could be useful:

`M-x x-symbol-list-info'
`?'
`h'
`i'
     Display info for character under point in echo area.

`M-x x-symbol-list-bury'
`q'
     Bury list buffer while trying to use the old window configuration.

   You can control the grid by the following variables:

`x-symbol-local-grid'
     With a valid token language, the Grid only contains insertion
     commands for valid characters and might use a coloring scheme.
     Otherwise, it contains all characters.

`x-symbol-temp-grid'
     Inserting an X-Symbol character does not restore the window
     configuration current before the invocation of the Grid.

`x-symbol-grid-reuse'
     Use old Grid when invoking command `x-symbol-grid', if this is
     reasonably to do.  If `x-symbol-grid' is called with a prefix
     argument, always create new Grid.

`x-symbol-grid-ignore-charsyms'
     The Grid does not contain `nobreakspace'.

`x-symbol-grid-tab-width'
     The tab width in the Grid buffer should correspond the font in
     `x-symbol-heading-face' which is also used as the default font in
     the Grid buffer.

`x-symbol-heading-strut-glyph'
     Use larger interline spacing if a line in the Grid starts with a
     header.

   The headers in the Grid are the same as the submenu headers, see
*Note Char Group::.  Similar looking characters for one headers are
grouped together.  *Note Input Method Context::.

   Input method Grid also works if X-Symbol mode is not enabled.  It
uses the common interpretation of prefix arguments for X-Symbol insert
commands, see *Note Introducing Input Methods::.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Input Method Keyboard,  Next: Input Method Context,  Prev: Input Method Grid,  Up: Input Methods

Input Method Keyboard: Compose Key Sequence
===========================================

   Key sequences starting with `C-=' (*note Introducing Input
Methods::.) are used to insert X-Symbol characters, e.g., `C-= ~ >'
inserts `leadsto'.  The Ascii sequence of the keys after `C-=' look
similar to the character which you are going to insert.  It is the same
as the sequence which is replaced by input method Context, see *Note
Input Method Context::.

   If many characters are represented by the same Ascii sequence, the
binding is extended by `1', `2' and so on.  If you do not know how to
continue your key sequence, the following commands might be useful:

`M-x x-symbol-help'
`C-= ZERO-OR-MORE-KEYS <help>'
`C-= ZERO-OR-MORE-KEYS C-h'
     Pops up a buffer displaying possible completions for the key
     sequence `C-= ZERO-OR-MORE-KEYS'.  You do not have to type the key
     sequence again, i.e., `C-= ZERO-OR-MORE-KEYS' is also used for the
     next input.

`C-= ZERO-OR-MORE-KEYS <button1>'
`C-= ZERO-OR-MORE-KEYS <button2>'
`C-= ZERO-OR-MORE-KEYS <button3>'
     Use the normal bindings of `<button1>',  `<button2>' or
     `<button3>', respectively (*note Input Method Grid::.).  The key
     sequence is not used for the next input.

`C-= ZERO-OR-MORE-KEYS M-<prior>'
`C-= ZERO-OR-MORE-KEYS M-<next>'
`C-= ZERO-OR-MORE-KEYS M-<home>'
`C-= ZERO-OR-MORE-KEYS M-<end>'
     Execute the commands `scroll-other-window-down',
     `scroll-other-window', `beginning-of-buffer-other-window' or
     `end-of-buffer-other-window', respectively.  You do not have to
     type the key sequence again, i.e., `C-= ZERO-OR-MORE-KEYS' is also
     used for the next input.

`x-symbol-temp-help'
     Inserting an X-Symbol character restores the window configuration
     current before the invocation of the Grid.

`x-symbol-map-default-keys-alist'
     Defines the bindings mentioned above.

   Input method Keyboard also works if X-Symbol mode is not enabled.  It
uses the common interpretation of prefix arguments for X-Symbol insert
commands, see *Note Introducing Input Methods::.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Input Method Context,  Next: Input Method Electric,  Prev: Input Method Keyboard,  Up: Input Methods

Input Method Context: Replace Char Sequence
===========================================

   The idea of the input method "Context" is to replace a sequence of
characters by a character which looks similar to the whole sequence.  If
the sequence consists only of Ascii characters, it is also used for the
key bindings, see *Note Input Method Keyboard::.

   There will be some info in the echo area that the character sequence
before point can be replace via input method Context.  The following
commands are provided:

`M-x x-symbol-modify-key'
`C-,'
`C-= <left>'
`C-= <right>'
     If character before point is an X-Symbol character, "modify" it to
     an alternative character (if you do it often enough, you are back
     at your first character).  Otherwise replace sequence of
     characters by a character which looks similar to the whole
     sequence.

`M-x x-symbol-rotate-key'
`C-.'
`C-= <up>'
`C-= <down>'
     If character before point is an X-Symbol character, "rotate" its
     "direction" (or change uppercase/lowercase).

   Both commands can also be used to resolve a character alias before
point, see *Note Char Aliases::.  If the region is active, restrict
replacement to use that region since the input method Context only
considers the longest sequence of characters with a replacement.

   Input method Context can be customized by changing the following
variables:

`x-symbol-rotate-prefix-alist'
     If you provide a prefix argument to command `x-symbol-rotate-key',
     you can specify the direction you want to have: it is according to
     numerical keypads, e.g., with prefix argument `7' you specify the
     direction "north-west".

`x-symbol-rotate-suffix-char'
     Command `x-symbol-rotate-key' is also used to "Greekify" the
     previous character: typing `a C-.' is shorter than `a # C-,'.

`x-symbol-context-ignore'
     Constrains whether a context/charsym can be replaced.  No
     constraints by default.

`x-symbol-context-init-ignore'
     Contexts starting with a space cannot be replaced.  This variable
     must be set before X-Symbol has been initialized.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Input Method Electric,  Next: Input Method Quail,  Prev: Input Method Context,  Up: Input Methods

Input Method Electric: Automatic Context
========================================

   The idea of input method "Electric" is to have the input method
Context (*note Input Method Context::.) do its replacement
automatically.  X-Symbol automatically replaces some character
sequences of input method Context by the X-Symbol character as soon as
the last character in the sequence of the sequence has been pressed.

   Input method Electric has nothing to do with the display of
super-/subscripts (*note Super and Subscripts::.).

   You might want to press `C-/' or `C-x u' to undo the replacement.
Input method Electric requires X-Symbol mode to be enabled, it can be
disabled (and re-enabled) by setting the following variable:

`x-symbol-electric-input'
     A boolean which can also be changed via the X-Symbol menu.

   To make input method Electric useful and not annoying, several
conditions must be met for X-Symbol to do the auto-replacement:

   * Not all contexts will be replaced automatically.  E.g., while input
     method Context allows both pre- and postfixes for accented
     characters, `:' and `'' only act as prefixes, and ``' and `~' only
     as postfixes for input method Electric, since these are the
     combinations where those characters are quite likely not used
     literally.

   * The character must be valid in the current token language, see
     *Note Introducing Input Methods::.

   * All characters of the context have been typed without any other
     command in between, e.g., `- >' inserts `arrowright', "- <left>
     <right> > simply inserts `->'.

   * No prefix argument has been used for any character in the context.

   * The electric context must not be a suffix of a longer valid
     context for another character.  E.g., `' ' o' does not insert
     `'`oacute'' because `''o' is the context for `ohungarumlaut'
     (which cannot be inserted by input method Electric).

   * It should be "allowed" to change the context to the character via
     input method Context.

   * Individual contexts/charsyms can be disabled by setting the
     following variables:

    `x-symbol-electric-ignore'
          The context should neither be `'s' (this would be annoying
          when writing English), nor include a space.  If you want to
          disable input method Electric for all accented characters, use

               (setq x-symbol-electric-ignore
                     "[ \t]\\|[A-Za-z][~`]\\|[:'][A-Za-z]")

    `x-symbol-LANG-electric-ignore'
          Individual contexts/charsyms can be disabled for each token
          language LANG.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Input Method Quail,  Next: Customizing Input Method,  Prev: Input Method Electric,  Up: Input Methods

Input Method Quail: a Mule Input Method
=======================================

   Another way to insert a characters is by using the Emacs/Mule
multilingual text input method "x-symbol" (*note Input Methods:
(xemacs)Input Methods.)..

   Again, the Ascii sequence used there is the same as the sequence
which is replaced by input method Context, see *Note Input Method
Context::.  A one-letter key sequence is extended by <;>.

   If input method Quail is selected for a buffer, input method Electric
(*note Input Method Electric::.) is disabled in that buffer.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Customizing Input Method,  Prev: Input Method Quail,  Up: Input Methods

Customizing Input Methods
=========================

   You may safely define key bindings not using the `x-symbol-map'
(i.e., starting with `C-=').  E.g., for `alpha' on `A-a' , use

     (global-set-key [(alt a)] 'x-symbol-INSERT-alpha)

   Please note that the command `x-symbol-INSERT-alpha' is not defined
before the main file (`x-symbol') in the package has been loaded (if
you really need it, function `autoload' is your friend).

   Other possibilities to customize the input methods are by setting the
following variables:

`x-symbol-header-groups-alist'
     Defines the groups whose characters appear after that header in
     the Grid and in submenus with that header.  *Note Char Group::.
     Extra variables exists for the language dependent Grid and Menu.

`x-symbol-group-input-alist'
`x-symbol-user-table'
     These are variables which are used to compute the input
     definitions.  While this kind of indirection might seem
     complicated to you (it is), it actually ensures consistency across
     all input methods.  *Note Defining Input Methods::.

     For example., if you prefer charsym `epsilon1' over `epsilon'
     (influences input method , you might want to use:

          (setq x-symbol-user-table
                '((epsilon1 t (greek1 "e" nil "epsilon") nil -3000)))

`x-symbol-list-mode-hook'
     Additional functions to execute after setting up the Grid and Key
     Completions buffer.

`x-symbol-after-init-input-hook'
     You can change the input methods directly by functions in these
     hooks.

Features of Package X-Symbol
****************************

   Package X-Symbol not only provides input methods for X-Symbol
characters, it also provides more features which support an easy and
comfortable preparation of documents.

* Menu:

* Super and Subscripts::        Use special fonts for super-/subscripts.
* Images::                      Images after image insertion commands.
* Info::                        Display information in echo area.
* Ascii Representation::        Derive label from a buffer contents.
* Package Information::         Invoke info system, use WWW browser.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Super and Subscripts,  Next: Images,  Prev: Features,  Up: Features

Super- and Subscripts
=====================

   Package X-Symbol displays the characters inside super-/subscript
commands in a way to make them look like super-/subscripts.  It also
marks the super-/subscript command itself as invisible, so you don't see
it on the screen.  For example, the three characters `a^2' in the
buffer are *displayed* as an `a' and a raised, smaller `2'--the `^' is
still in the buffer.

   Therefore, the display of super- and subscripts has nothing to do
with Input Method Electric (*note Input Method Electric::.).

   Do not confuse the special Latin characters `twosuperior',
`threesuperior', `ordfeminine' and `masculine' with the characters `2',
`3', `a' and `o' when displayed as superscripts.  You might notice that
the characters look a bit different, but to help you seeing the
difference, X-Symbol will display an info in the echo area (*note
Info::.) for the special Latin characters when point is before or after
the character in question.

   X-Symbol only displays the innermost super- and subscripts, since we
would need even more additional fonts otherwise.  It is also restricted
to display single-line super- and subscripts.

   The display of super- and subscripts requires `font-lock' to be
enabled (*note Role of font-lock::.).

   Super- and subscripts are by default enabled if the they are defined
for the token language and it would be appropriate to turn on X-Symbol
automatically for the current buffer (*note Minor Mode::.).  They can be
disabled (and re-enabled) by setting the following buffer-local
variable:

`x-symbol-subscripts'
     A boolean which can also be changed via the X-Symbol menu.

   As mentioned before, X-Symbol marks the super-/subscript command
itself as invisible, except when point is directly before, inside or
directly after this command.  During the time where this this is the
case, X-Symbol makes the super-/subscript command reappear and
highlights it with pink.  This feature can be disabled (and re-enabled)
by setting the following variables:

`x-symbol-reveal-invisible'
     A boolean which can also be changed via the X-Symbol menu.

`x-symbol-revealed-face'
     The face used for the super-/subscript command when revealed.

`x-symbol-idle-delay'
     Time in seconds of idle time before revealing invisible characters.

   Super-/subscript commands are `^'/`_' (*note TeX Macro::.) and
`<sup>'/`<sub>' (*note SGML Entity::.):

`x-symbol-LANG-font-lock-keywords'
     The super-/subscript `font-lock' keywords for each token language
     LANG.

Images at the end of Image Insertion Commands
=============================================

   Package X-Symbol can display "images" at the end of image insertion
commands.  They show thumbnails (scaled-down version of the image) for
the included image files (using `convert', *note Installing Image
Converter::.).  Using the middle mouse button invokes the image editor
for the image under the mouse pointer.

* Menu:

* Image Display::               When to display images.
* Image Conversion::            Producing a scaled-down image.
* Image Caching::               Speeding up the image processing.
* Special Images::              Signaling specific situations.
* Image Editor::                Editing the original image file.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Image Display,  Next: Image Conversion,  Prev: Images,  Up: Images

Display of Images
-----------------

   The display of images is by default enabled if the image commands are
defined for the token language and it would be appropriate to turn on
X-Symbol automatically for the current buffer (*note Minor Mode::.).  It
can be disabled (and re-enabled) by setting the following buffer-local
variable:

`x-symbol-image'
     A boolean which can also be changed via the X-Symbol menu.

   Image commands are `\includegraphics' and others (*note TeX
Macro::.), and `<img>' (*note SGML Entity::.):

`x-symbol-LANG-image-keywords'
     The keywords (image commands & arguments) for each token language
     LANG.

   File names in the image commands must be interpreted correctly.  They
can be:

   - "absolute", start with `/' or `~',

   - "explicitly relative", start with `./' or `../',

   - "implicitly relative", assumed otherwise, e.g., `image.eps', or

   - special, like having some special URL prefix like `http:' or
     `ftp:'.

   Relative file names can be relative to some "master directory"
(usually the current directory of the file) or to directories in some
"search path" (only used with token language `tex'):

`x-symbol-LANG-master-directory'
     The master directory for each token language LANG.

`x-symbol-LANG-image-searchpath'
     The image search path for each token language LANG.  Defaults to
     the current directory.

`x-symbol-image-searchpath-follow-symlink'
     Directories in the search path ending with `//' (double slash) are
     recursive: all subdirectories not starting with a dot are also
     included in the search path.  If this variable has value `nil' (the
     default), subdirectories which are symbolic links are not included.

   For details, see the section of the individual token languages

Image Conversion
----------------

   The file mentioned inside the image insertion command is not used
directly to display the image after the command.  The image might be too
big, it might use too many colors or the image format might not be
supported by Emacs.  Therefore, it is converted to an "image cache
file", see *Note Image Caching::.

`x-symbol-image-max-width'
     The image is not wider than 120 points.

`x-symbol-image-max-height'
     The image is not higher than 80 points.

`x-symbol-image-convert-colormap'
     Colormap used in function `x-symbol-image-convert-colormap' below.
     A colormap is a normal image whose colors are the only ones used
     for producing other images.  The distribution of package X-Symbol
     includes two colormaps: `etc/colormap138.xpm' and
     `etc/colormap66.xpm'.

`x-symbol-image-colormap-allocation'
     Package X-Symbol allocates the colors of the colormap at start-up
     and prevents them to be de-allocated.

`x-symbol-image-converter'
     Program `convert' from ImageMagick is used to convert the images
     (*note Installing Image Converter::.).  Set this variable to `nil',
     if you don't want to convert images.

     The following variables controls the invocation of the program
     `convert' from ImageMagick:

    `x-symbol-image-convert-program'
          The name of the program `convert', it is
          `C:\\ImageMagick\\convert' when running on Windows and
          `convert' otherwise.

    `x-symbol-image-convert-file-alist'
          Program `convert' needs to be told that `FILE.pstex' is a
          Postscript file.

     The following functions are possible values in
     `x-symbol-image-converter':

    `x-symbol-image-start-convert-mono'
          Produces monochrome images.  Used if your device has less
          than 32 colors.

    `x-symbol-image-start-convert-truecolor'
          Produce images with original colors.  Used if your device has
          more than 767 colors.

    `x-symbol-image-start-convert-color'
          Produce images with maximal four colors (just four because
          different images might use a different sets of colors).  Used
          otherwise without a colormap.

    `x-symbol-image-start-convert-colormap'
          Produce image with colors from the colormap.  Used otherwise
          with a colormap.

         `x-symbol-image-convert-mono-regexp'
               Function `x-symbol-image-start-convert-colormap' just
               produces monochrome images for temporary image cache
               files (*note Image Caching::.) since `convert' is slower
               when using a colormap.

Image Caching
-------------

   Editing would be extremely slow, if an image cache file would be
produced every time an image insertion command has been recognized.
Therefore, package X-Symbol uses the following techniques:

   * It uses an asynchronous process to create the image cache file.
     You can edit your file during the conversion.

   * It uses a "file cache": image cache file can be kept for future
     Emacs sessions.

   * It uses a "memory cache": images from the most common file names
     are cached in a buffer-local memory cache.  The cached is
     initialized when parsing the whole buffer for image keywords.
     Rescan the buffer if you want to display the the images of new
     image files by using the following command:

    `M-x x-symbol-image-parse-buffer'
          Parse the buffer to recognize image insertion commands.
          Usually, this is done automatically.

   File and memory caching can be controlled by the following variables:

`x-symbol-image-update-cache'
     The image cache is automatically updated if it does not exist yet
     or if it is older than the corresponding image file.

`x-symbol-image-cache-directories'
     Cache files for images in your home directory are stored in
     directory `~/.images/', e.g., image `~/d/img.eps', is cached in
     `~/.images/d/img.png'.

     Images outside your home directory are just temporarily cached, or
     not displayed at all if they cannot be stored in the memory cache.

     You could also specify that the cache files uses a relative
     subdirectory, e.g., that `~/d/img.eps' is cached in
     `~/d/.img/img.eps' or that the image is not displayed at all.

`x-symbol-image-temp-name'
     Temporary image files are stored in a temporary directory (`/tmp/')
     having some unique name.  They are not supported on Emacs.

`x-symbol-image-use-remote'
     Package X-Symbol only displays images which can be stored in the
     memory cache.  With value `t', it tries to find the image file
     during editing (ignoring the search path for speed, though).
     Editing lines with image files not in the memory cache would be
     slow, since file accesses are necessary for every command.

   The memory cache only stored image file from the current directory or
some standard image directories like `figures/' (*note TeX Macro::.),
or `images/' or `pictures/' (*note SGML Entity::.).  Otherwise, the
image file is considered similar to remote files:

`x-symbol-LANG-image-cached-dirs'
     The directories with images which are stored in the memory cache.
     Can be separately defined for each token language LANG.

Special Images for Specific Situations
--------------------------------------

   If package X-Symbol cannot display images representing the included
image files, it uses special images instead:

   * "Remote:" An Escher knot is displayed if the file is remote or if
     the image cannot be cached in the memory cache, see *Note Image
     Caching::.

   * "Junk": A recycle sign is displayed if there is no image converter
     (*note Image Conversion::.), if it should not use a file cache or
     if the file cache cannot be written.

   * "Locked:" A terminal with a lock is displayed if the image cache
     file cannot be read or written.

   * "Design:" An ink pen is displayed if the image file does not exist.

   * "Create:" An hour glass is displayed used during the creation of
     the image cache file, an old image cache is used instead if it
     exists.

   * "Broken:" A tombstone is displayed if the creation of the image
     cache file has failed.

   To customize the glyphs for the special images, use:

`x-symbol-image-data-directory'
     Directory of files for the special images.

`x-symbol-image-special-glyphs'
     File names of special images and their image format.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Image Editor,  Prev: Special Images,  Up: Images

Image Editor
------------

   If you move the mouse pointer to an image insertion command or its
image, it is highlighted.

`<button2>'
     Start image editor for highlighted image.  If the image is
     searched in the searchpath (*note Image Caching::.), edit first
     existing image file.  If no image exists, open a new file in the
     first directory of the searchpath.

`<button3>'
     Pop up the "image highlight menu".  You can rescan the buffer for
     image insertion commands (*note Image Display::.).

     It also displays all directories in the searchpath if the file
     name is implicitly relative, or the current directory otherwise.
     Selecting a directory starts the image editor in that directory
     (relatively to that directory if the file name has a directory
     part).

`M-x x-symbol-image-editor'
     Start image editor.  Asks for the image file.

   You can control which editor to use:

`x-symbol-image-editor-alist'
     Normally, program `display' is used to edit the highlighted image
     file.  But for image names `FILE.eps', `FILE.ps' or `FILE.pstex',
     program `xfig' is invoked with `FILE.fig'.  It also uses a scale
     method, e.g., with `img.80.eps', we edit `img.fig' (which should
     be exported with scale=80%).

`x-symbol-image-scale-method'
     If a scale method is used for a file name and the file name without
     extension ends with a dot and two digits, these three characters
     are removed from the file name.

`x-symbol-image-current-marker'
     Directories with an existing image for the specified file name are
     marked with an `*'.  The first of these represents the file which
     is used when pressing `<button2>'.

Info in Echo Area
=================

   The echo area (*note Echo Area: (xemacs)Echo Area.) is used by
X-Symbol to give some information about the character around point, and
whether there is a context before point which can be replaced by input
method Context (*note Input Method Context::.).

   It will be controlled by the following variables (also to be found in
the menu):

`x-symbol-character-info'
     A three-value variable which controls whether to display some info
     for the character after or around point.  The info for the
     character after point includes the character itself and the
     following infos:

        - the token of the current language, eventually colored
          according to some coloring scheme (*note Char Group::.),

        - infos using the token classes (*note Char Group::.), which
          could inform users to include a specific LaTeX package when
          they want to use that character in the document,

        - the codings in which the characters is considered to be a
          8bit character (*note File Coding::.), and

        - the key bindings (*note Input Method Keyboard::.).

`x-symbol-context-info'
     If X-Symbol mode is on and some conditions are met, display some
     info for the character which would replace the context before
     point when pressing `C-,' (*note Input Method Context::.).  It can
     be controlled by the following variables:

    `x-symbol-context-info-ignore'
          The default value `x-symbol-default-context-info-ignore'
          makes the following variables control whether to display the
          context info.

    `x-symbol-context-info-threshold'
          The context does not consist of a single character.

    `x-symbol-context-info-ignore-regexp'
          The context does not solely consist of letters.

    `x-symbol-context-info-ignore-groups'
          The context is not replaced by an accented character, see
          *Note Char Group::.

`x-symbol-idle-delay'
     Time in seconds of idle time before showing the info.

Ascii Representation of Strings
===============================

   If you want to derive labels from a buffer contents (provided e.g.,
by Emacs packages `reftex' or `bibtex'), you need a Ascii
representation of strings containing X-Symbol characters.  This is
provided by the following function:

`x-symbol-translate-to-ascii'
     Takes a string and returns a string only consisting of Ascii
     characters.

    `x-symbol-charsym-ascii-alist'
          You might want to define the German way to Asciify accented
          characters by:
               (setq x-symbol-charsym-ascii-alist
                     '((adiaeresis . "ae") (Adiaeresis . "Ae")
                       (odiaeresis . "oe") (Odiaeresis . "Oe")
                       (udiaeresis . "ue") (Udiaeresis . "Ue")))

    `x-symbol-charsym-ascii-groups'
          By default, "Ascii"fying accented characters means removing
          the accents.  Other characters have built-in Ascii
          representation, e.g, `sigma1' has the Ascii representation
          `sigma'.

Pseudo Token Language "x-symbol charsym"
========================================

   If no (or an invalid) token language is set for a buffer, the info in
the echo area (*note Info::.) for a X-Symbol Character in the buffer (if
it exists) uses the name of its "charsym".  In this manual, we actually
refer to X-Symbol characters by their charsym name, e.g., `alpha'.

   A charsym is a symbol which is used internally to represent a
X-Symbol character.  Charsyms are used instead characters in all user
variables of package X-Symbol.

   The highlight menu of the Grid (*note Input Method Grid::.) also
offers to insert a charsym name.  Charsyms can also be used for input
method Read Token, see *Note Input Method Read Token::.

   You cannot use this pseudo language to turn on the X-Symbol minor
mode (*note Minor Mode::.), you cannot decode charsyms to their
characters, and you cannot encode characters to charsyms.

Token Language "TeX macro" (`tex')
==================================

   For buffers using the major mode `latex-mode', `tex-mode' or
`plain-tex-mode', we use token language "TeX macro" (`tex').  This
language provides the display of super-/subscripts and images.  If the
buffer visits a file with extension `.tex', X-Symbol mode is
automatically turned on.

File: x-symbol.info,  Node: TeX Macro Basics,  Next: TeX Macro Features,  Prev: TeX Macro,  Up: TeX Macro

Basics of Language "TeX macro"
------------------------------

   The standard behavior can be controlled by the following variables:

`x-symbol-tex-modes'
`x-symbol-tex-auto-style'
     The variables known from *Note Minor Mode::.  If the buffer visits
     a file with extension `.tex', super-/subscripts and images are
     displayed, otherwise unique decoding (*note Unique Decoding::.)
     will be used.

`x-symbol-tex-auto-coding-alist'
     Used there to automatically deduce the specific encoding of the
     file (*note File Coding::.) if the file visited by the buffer has
     the extension `.tex'.  It searches for one of the following two
     strings in the current buffer, including the comment:

          \usepackage[ENCODING]{inputenc}
          %& -translation-file=iENC

     where ENCODING should be one of `latin1', `latin2', `latin3',
     `latin5', or `latin9', and ENC should be one of `l1' or `l2'.
     8bit characters are not encoded if the file if the search was
     successful (*note Controlling 8bit Coding::.).

`x-symbol-tex-coding-master'
     If one of the above strings cannot be found in the current buffer,
     and the current buffer has a buffer-local string value of
     `TeX-master', also search in the file denoted by that value for
     the strings.  (Buffer-local variables will not be inherited.)

   The input methods and the character info in the echo area are
controlled by:

`x-symbol-tex-header-groups-alist'
     We use the standard Grid and Menu headers.

`x-symbol-tex-extra-menu-items'
     There is an extra menu item to remove the braces around text-mode
     letters and other text-mode symbols.

`x-symbol-tex-electric-ignore'
`x-symbol-tex-electric-ignore-regexp'
     Input method Electric (*note Input Method Electric::.) is disabled
     if the character is not of the correct TeX mode, i.e., it only
     produces a math-mode character in a math area and a text-mode
     character in a text area (this test requires package `texmathp',
     *Note LaTeX Packages::).  Postfix tilde is not electric, because
     `~' produces a space in TeX.

`x-symbol-tex-token-suppress-space'
     Input method Token (*note Input Method Token::.) only converts a
     token ending with a control word like `\i', if the character
     following the token is no letter.  If that token is a text-mode
     token and a <SPC> has been entered without a prefix argument, the
     <SPC> will only perform the replacement, it will not insert a
     space, i.e., it will act like `C-u 0 <SPC>'.

`x-symbol-tex-class-alist'
`x-symbol-tex-class-face-alist'
     Various token classes (*note Char Group::.) are defined.  They are
     used to give some info (*note Info::.) about the characters
     spacing behavior, which LaTeX packages are necessary to use the
     character (*note TeX Macro Symbols::.), and about the conversion
     (*note TeX Macro Conversion::.).  X-Symbol uses blue for text-mode
     only and purple for math-mode only characters in the Grid (*note
     Input Method Grid::. and the character info.

Super-/Subscripts and Images in LaTeX
-------------------------------------

   The display of super- and subscripts (*note Super and Subscripts::.)
is controlled by:

`x-symbol-tex-font-lock-limit-regexp'
     The superscript command `^' and the subscript command `_' is
     recognized.  The argument can be provided with and without braces.
     The argument should not span more than one line and should not
     contain a super-/subscript command.

`x-symbol-tex-font-lock-allowed-faces'
     The characters `^' and `_' are not always commands (*note TeX
     Macro Problems::.), e.g., in the argument of `\ref'.  X-Symbol uses
     the usual syntax highlighting keywords to decide whether to
     recognize these characters as super-/subscript commands: they are
     commands if they are not highlighted or highlighted with the usual
     math-mode faces.

     This might lead to problems: *Note FAQ No Subscripts::, *Note FAQ
     Stupid Subscripts::.  Using `texmathp' (*note LaTeX Packages::.)
     has even more problems:

        - The syntax highlighting (which is used for super-/subscripts)
          would be much too slow.

        - With own LaTeX environments, you would need to customize
          `texmathp'.

        - It is actually wrong: whether `^' and `_' are
          super-/subscripts commands does not depend on whether we are
          in TeX's math mode, it depends on its catcodes (which are
          changed by commands like `\ref').

   The display of images (*note Images::.) is controlled by:

`x-symbol-tex-image-keywords'
     The following commands are recognized.  Extension EXT stands for
     `eps' (which is the default extension for both versions of
     `\includegraphics' if the extension is omitted there), `ps',
     `gif', `png', `jpeg', `jpg', or `pdf'.  Options OPTIONS can be
     omitted with their surrounding brackets or preceding comma,
     respectively.

          \input{FILE.pstex_t}
          \includegraphics[OPTIONS][OPTIONS]{FILE.EXT}
          \includegraphics*[OPTIONS][OPTIONS]{FILE.EXT}
          \epsfig{file=FILE.EXT,OPTIONS}
          \psfig{file=FILE.EXT,OPTIONS}
          \epsfbox[OPTIONS]{FILE.EXT}
          \epsffile[OPTIONS]{FILE.EXT}

`x-symbol-tex-master-directory'
     Relative file names (*note Image Display::., explicitly or
     implicitly) are relative to the directory part of variable
     `TeX-master' if it is buffer-local and a string.  Otherwise, they
     are relative to the directory of the current file.

`x-symbol-tex-image-searchpath'
     Files with implicitly relative names are meant to be searched in a
     search path.  It defaults to the list of directories specified by
     the environment variable `TEXPICTS' or `TEXINPUTS' (*note TeX
     environment variables: (kpathsea)TeX environment variables.),
     extended by `./' if necessary.

     Each directory in this list is used to expand the file name.  The
     first expansion naming a readable file is used.  Relative
     directories in this list are expanded in the master directory
     mentioned above.

     This mimics the standard behavior of TeX, omitting the "built-in"
     directories of the search path (*note Path sources: (kpathsea)Path
     sources.).

`x-symbol-tex-image-cached-dirs'
     The file name in the image command should not have a directory
     part or the directory part should be `figures/' if the image
     should be cached in the memory cache.

Problems with TeX Macros
------------------------

   Like with other token languages, the conversion between characters
and TeX macros induce the problem that we have two conflicting
requirements: we would like X-Symbol not to change the file when
visiting and saving a file, and we would like X-Symbol to use characters
for all corresponding macros.  *Note Unique Decoding::.

   The additional problem with TeX macros is that there is no fixed and
simple definition of TeX macros, and many users have their personal TeX
style, while many users are probably not aware that the style also
influences TeX's typesetting:

   * The tokens in TeX are not ended by a dedicated character (like
     SGML entities are ended by `;').  Instead, we need the next char
     to decide whether a macro ends, which would be no problem if TeX
     would have a character which has no meaning except separating
     tokens (like space in most programming languages).  Unfortunately,
     this is not the case: after an "control word" (an all-letter
     macro), a space has no meaning, but it does produce a space in the
     output after characters and other macros, except in math mode.

     During decoding, a text-mode control word has to be replaced
     either with its trailing spaces or not be replaced at all.  Since
     the number of spaces can vary and X-Symbol does not remember the
     original TeX sequence of a character, X-Symbol would change the
     file if it would use characters for all sequences.

   * During encoding, a space after a character in the buffer must
     produce a space in the document output, since users normally do
     not care whether the character is represented by a control word or
     not.  Let us assume that we (Bavarians) want to produce the output
     `Mass Bier'.  In the info file, you will probably not see any 8bit
     characters (the sharp `s' is shown as `ss').

        - Many people would use `Ma\ss\ Bier'.  This is (almost ever)
          fine in text mode, but a `\ ' in math mode is not ignored
          (whereas the spaces after characters are).  If we have text-
          and math-mode control word, we have a problem, since
          math-mode detection cannot work properly without TeX
          processing.

        - Many people would use `Ma\ss{} Bier'.  This has less problems
          and is therefore used by X-Symbol.  The `{}' at the end of
          the control word is not used if the character is not followed
          by a space, e.g., to produce `Strasse', we use `Stra\ss e'.
          Consequently, `Ma\ss\ Bier' in the file would be decoded to
          `Mass\ Bier', which would be encoded to the original sequence
          in the file.

        - Some people would always use `{}' after a text-mode control
          word, even it is not followed by a space, like `Stra\ss{}e'.
          This is wrong, since it breaks ligatures and kerns.  For
          example, compare the output of `\L V' with `\L{}V' using `T1'
          font encoding.

        - Up to Version 4.1, X-Symbol surrounded a text-mode control
          word with braces, like `Stra{\ss}e'.  This was probably even
          worse than always adding `{}' at the end of the control word.
          It was used, because it is required by BibTeX (*note BibTeX
          Macro::.).  Unfortunately, BibTeX sends this bad sequence
          directly to LaTeX, but this has nothing to do with X-Symbol.

   * The accented characters are not represented by one tokens in TeX.
     Most people use `\"a' to produce an `"a', while some use `\"{a}'.
     X-Symbol uses the former, it does not even decode the latter
     automatically.  Up to Version 4.1, X-Symbol used `{\"a}', having
     the same problems as using `Stra{\ss}e'.

   * Around a dozen characters can be produced by more than one TeX
     macro, like `\neq' and `\ne'.  Here, X-Symbol decodes both forms,
     because it is probably a bad idea to redefine standard TeX macros.
     This will not be done with in style files (*note Unique
     Decoding::.).

   * In TeX, you can change the lexer on the fly, i.e., in a strict
     sense, any conversion is unsafe without TeX processing.  Since the
     most likely change is to change the catcode of the character `@'
     to a letter (used in LaTeX's style files), this character is
     considered a letter by X-Symbol.  This means that although both
     `\ss @' and `\ss@' usually produce the same output, only the first
     is decoded to `ss@'.

   * In TeX, the definitions of macros can also change on the fly i.e.,
     in a strict sense, any conversion is unsafe without TeX processing.
     X-Symbol assumes that you do not do something like that except as
     done by the standard LaTeX `\verb' command, and the `verbatim' and
     `tabbing' environments.

The Conversion of TeX Macros
----------------------------

   The TeX macros for Latin characters are according to the LaTeX
package `inputenc.sty', v0.97+.  Package X-Symbol uses U00B5 for
`\mathmicro', not for `\mu', though!  *Note Wishlist LaTeX::.

   It is assumed that you do not redefine standard TeX macros like
`\ne' (*note TeX Macro Conversion::.), if you do so, you should better
use unique decoding (*note Unique Decoding::.).

   The encoding of characters to TeX macros works as follows:

   * If the character is preceded by an odd number of backslashes,
     insert a space before the character.

   * Accented characters are encoded without braces, e.g., we encode
     `c,' to `\c c'.  Accents are encoded with braces, e.g., we use
     `\c{ }' and `\u{}'.

   Additionally, the encoding of characters to TeX macros which are
"control words" (all-letter macros), or whose TeX representation ends
with a control word (like `\'\i') works as follows:

   * If the character is followed by a letter, replace the character by
     the macro and insert a space.

   * If the macro is a text-mode macro and followed by one or more
     blanks, replace the character and insert `{}'.

   * Otherwise, just replace the character.

   The decoding of TeX macros which are control words to characters
works as follows:

   * If the macro is a text-mode macro and followed by `{}' which is
     followed by a blank, replace the macro and delete the braces.

   * If the macro is a text-mode macro and followed by one are more
     blanks, we have the following rule:

        - If we have exactly one blank, the blank is a space, and it is
          not followed by a `%' (comment character), replace the macro
          by the corresponding character and delete the space.  (The
          character following the space must be a letter with unique
          decoding, *Note Unique Decoding::.)

        - Otherwise, do *not decode* the macro!

   * Otherwise, just replace the macro.

   To clarify, "letter" means `A'-`Z', `a'-`z', or `@', "blank" means a
space, newline or the end of the buffer (therefore, the last character
in the buffer is always followed by a blank).

   There are three control words which are both text-mode and math mode
macros: `\ldots', `\vdots', and (by accident) `\angle'.  They are all
treated like math-mode characters, but their minibuffer info (*note
Info::.) includes `gobbles space' (spaces in the buffer after the
character have no impact on the document),

   Additionally, the following commands and environments are processed
during decoding (but we are just looking for strings, i.e., they are
also processed in comments):

`x-symbol-tex-verb-delimiter-regexp'
     If the command `\verb' is found, its argument is not decoded if it
     is delimited by one of the following characters: `-', `!', `#',
     `$', `&', `*', `+', `/', `=', `?', `^', `|', or `!'.

`x-symbol-tex-env-verbatim-regexp'
     The contents of the `verbatim' environment is not decoded.  To
     produce accented characters inside this environment, use the LaTeX
     package `inputenc.sty'.

`x-symbol-tex-env-tabbing-regexp'
     Inside a `tabbing' environment, the macro sequences starting with
     `\`', `\'', `\=' and `\-' are not decoded.  It is probably better
     (with or without X-Symbol) to use the LaTeX package `inputenc.sty'
     or to the `Tabbing' environment, to be found in the CTAN archives.

   During encoding, these commands and environments are not respected,
since it does not make any sense to have X-Symbol's private characters
in the TeX file.

   Final note: in the info file, you will probably not see any 8bit
characters.

   You might want change the conversion between characters and tokens in
language `tex' by changing:

`x-symbol-tex-user-table'
     You can define you own tokens for X-Symbol characters.  E.g., if
     you like to have the command `\sqrt' represented by a character
     (shadowing the entry for `\surd'), add the following to your
     `~/.emacs':

          (setq x-symbol-tex-user-table '((radical (math special) "\\sqrt")))

Extra Symbols of Language "TeX Macro"
-------------------------------------

   This section describes what you should put into your private style
file or your document if you want to use extra symbols, i.e., characters
whose info in the echo area (*note Info::.) contains s.th. like
`PACKAGE.sty' or `user'.  If you do not use the corresponding
characters, you do not have to do anything, of course.

   The TeX macros `\Box', `\Diamond', `\leadsto', `\Join', `\lhd',
`\mho', `\rhd', `\sqsupset', `\sqsubset', `\unlhd', `\unrhd', are
defined in LaTeX package `latexsym.sty':

     \usepackage{latexsym}

   Note that these macros are also defined `amssymb.sty'.  Since the
first four macros are defined differently (better) in `latexsym.sty',
it does make sense to load both LaTeX packages.

   The TeX macros `\boldsymbol', `\circledast', `\circledcirc',
`\circleddash', `\digamma', `\gtrapprox', `\gtrsim', `\lessapprox',
`\lesssim', `\triangleq', `\varkappa' are defined in AMS LaTeX package
`amssymb.sty':

     \usepackage{amssymb}

   The TeX macros `\bigsqcap', `\llbracket', `\rrbracket',
`\llparenthesis', `\rrparenthesis' are defined in the LaTeX package
`stmaryrd.sty':

     \usepackage{stmaryrd}

   The TeX macros `\guilsinglleft', `\guilsinglright', `\dj', `\NG',
`\ng', `\DH', `\DJ', `\dh', `\dj', `\TH', `\th', `\guillemotleft',
`\guillemotright' and the ogonek characters are only defined if you use
T1 font encoding:

     \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

   The TeX macro `\mathmicro' for U00B5 can be defined by (*note
Wishlist LaTeX::.):

     \let\mathmicro\mu

   You should define the following in your LaTeX file (if you use the
corresponding characters), the first can only be used with T1 font
encoding.

     \DeclareTextSymbol{\textbackslash}{T1}{92}
     \newcommand{\nsubset}{\not\subset}
     \newcommand{\textflorin}{\textit{f}}
     \newcommand{\setB}{{\mathord{\mathbb B}}}
     \newcommand{\setC}{{\mathord{\mathbb C}}}

     \newcommand{\setR}{{\mathord{\mathbb R}}}
     \newcommand{\setZ}{{\mathord{\mathbb Z}}}
     \newcommand{\coloncolon}{\mathrel{::}}

   The TeX macros `\textordfeminine', `\textordmasculine',
`\textdegree', `\textonequarter', `\textonehalf', `\textthreequarters',
`\mathonesuperior', `\mathtwosuperior', `\maththreesuperior',
`\textcopyright' are only defined when using LaTeX package
`inputenc.sty':

     \usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}

   The TeX macros `\textcent', `\textcurrency', `\textyen',
`\textbrokenbar', `\textmalteseH', `\textmalteseh' are defined as not
available in LaTeX package `inputenc.sty'.  *Note Wishlist LaTeX::.  If
you use this package and want to define these commands, use
`\renewcommand' (or `\def') after, e.g.:

     \usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
     \usepackage{wasysym}  %% defines \cent, \currency, \brokenvert
     \usepackage{amssymb}  %% defines \yen

Token Language "SGML entity" (`sgml')
=====================================

   For buffers using the major mode `html-mode', `hm--html-mode',
`html-helper-mode', `sgml-mode' or `xml-mode', we use token language
"SGML entity" (`sgml').  This language provides the display of
super-/subscripts and images.  If the buffer visits a file and uses a
HTML mode, X-Symbol mode is automatically turned on.

* Menu:

* SGML Entity Basics::          Basics of Language "SGML entity".

* SGML Entity Conversion::      How the conversion of SGML entities works.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: SGML Entity Basics,  Next: SGML Entity Features,  Prev: SGML Entity,  Up: SGML Entity

Basics of Language "SGML entity"
--------------------------------

   The standard behavior can be controlled by the following variables:

`x-symbol-sgml-modes'
`x-symbol-sgml-auto-style'
     The variables known from *Note Minor Mode::.  If the buffer uses a
     HTML mode, super-/subscripts and images are displayed, otherwise
     unique decoding (*note Unique Decoding::.) will be used.

`x-symbol-sgml-auto-coding-alist'
     Used there to automatically deduce the specific encoding of the
     file (*note File Coding::.).  It searches for the following string
     in the current buffer, including the comment:

          <meta http-equiv="content-type"
                content="text/html; charset=ENCODING">

     where ENCODING should be one of `iso-8859-1', `iso-8859-2',
     `iso-8859-3', `iso-8859-9', or `iso-8859-15'.  8bit characters are
     not encoded if the file if the search was successful (*note
     Controlling 8bit Coding::.).

   The input methods and the character info in the echo area are
controlled by:

`x-symbol-sgml-header-groups-alist'
     Defines the headers and their characters for the language specific
     Grid and Menu.

`x-symbol-sgml-extra-menu-items'
     There are no special entries in the X-Symbol menu.

`x-symbol-sgml-electric-ignore'
     There is no additional constraint to the ones mentioned in *Note
     Input Method Electric::.

`x-symbol-sgml-class-alist'
`x-symbol-sgml-class-face-alist'
     Token classes (*note Char Group::.) are only used to define a
     coloring scheme.  X-Symbol uses dark orange or dark red for
     non-Latin-1 characters in the Grid (*note Input Method Grid::. and
     the character info (*note Info::.), dark red for characters
     without defined entity names in HTML (*note SGML Entity
     Conversion::.).


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: SGML Entity Features,  Next: SGML Entity Conversion,  Prev: SGML Entity Basics,  Up: SGML Entity

Super-/Subscripts and Images in HTML
------------------------------------

   The display of super- and subscripts (*note Super and Subscripts::.)
is controlled by:

`x-symbol-sgml-font-lock-regexp'
`x-symbol-sgml-font-lock-limit-regexp'
`x-symbol-sgml-font-lock-alist'
`x-symbol-sgml-font-lock-contents-regexp'
     The superscript command `<sup>'...`</sup>' and the subscript
     command `<sub>'...`</sub>' is recognized.  The contents should
     contain at least one character which is not a space or a
     `nobreakspace'.

   The display of images (*note Images::.) is controlled by:

`x-symbol-sgml-image-keywords'
     The following commands are recognized.  Extension EXT stands for
     `gif', `png', `jpeg' or `jpg'.

          <img ... src="FILE.EXT" ...>

`x-symbol-sgml-master-directory'
`x-symbol-sgml-image-searchpath'
     Relative file names (*note Image Display::.) are relative to the
     directory of the current file.

`x-symbol-sgml-image-file-truename-alist'
     The file name prefix `file:' is ignored.  For any other file name
     which starts with letters and then a colon, e.g., with `http:' or
     `C:\' (which is no URL anyway), the image insertion command will
     be skipped.  By changing this variable, you could specify that the
     prefix `http://www.fmi.uni-passau.de/~wedler/' corresponds to
     `~/public_html/'.

`x-symbol-sgml-image-cached-dirs'
     The file name in the image command should not have a directory
     part or the directory part should be `images/' or `pictures/' if
     the image should be cached in the memory cache.

The Conversion of SGML Entities
-------------------------------

   Most character entities of HTML-4.0 are supported, except the
following: uppercase Greek which look like uppercase Latin,
"markup-significant and internationalization" characters, and some
quotes.  See `http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/sgml/entities.html'.

   By default, we encode to entity references like `&amp;', and decode
from both entity references and character references like `&#38;'.  For
Latin-N characters without defined entity names in HTML (e.g.
`scedilla'), we can only use character references.

   Do not expect Netscape before v6 to display non-Latin-1 characters
correctly (this might work by specifying the charset UTF-8 and using
character references).

   You might want change the conversion between characters and tokens in
language `sgml' by changing:

`x-symbol-sgml-token-list'
     A symbol, which defines whether to use entity references, character
     references, or entity references for Latin-1 characters and
     character references for others.

`x-symbol-sgml-user-table'
     It is probably not a good idea to change the defined tokens
     (except via the variable above), but you might want to add some
     definitions:

          (setq x-symbol-sgml-user-table '((circ () 999 "&bcomp;")))

Token Language "BibTeX macro" (`bib')
=====================================

   For buffers using the major mode `bibtex-mode', we use token
language "BibTeX macro" (`bib').  This language does not provide the
display of super-/subscripts and images.  If the buffer visits a file,
X-Symbol mode is automatically turned on.  It is controlled by:

`x-symbol-bib-modes'
`x-symbol-bib-auto-style'
     The variables known from *Note Minor Mode::.  There is no automatic
     deduction of the file encoding, 8bit characters are usually
     encoded, and there is usually no unique decoding.  *Note
     Conversion::.

   The major difference between this language and the token language
`tex' is that the tokens for text-mode characters are most likely
enclosed by braces.  This has some problems (*note TeX Macro
Problems::.), but is required by the program `bibtex'.

   The input methods and most features except super-/subscripts and
images work like in token language `tex' (*note TeX Macro::.):

`x-symbol-bib-header-groups-alist'
`x-symbol-bib-electric-ignore'
`x-symbol-bib-class-alist'
`x-symbol-bib-class-face-alist'
     Like in *Note TeX Macro Features::.

`x-symbol-bib-extra-menu-items'
     There are no special entries in the X-Symbol menu.

   You might want change the conversion between characters and tokens in
language `bib' by changing:

`x-symbol-bib-user-table'
`x-symbol-tex-user-table'
     Use the former for `bib'-only changes, the latter also influences
     the conversion with token language `tex'.

Token Language "TeXinfo command" (`texi')
=========================================

   For buffers using the major mode `texinfo-mode', we use token
language "TeXinfo command" (`texi').  This language does not provide
the display of super-/subscripts and images.  If the buffer visits a
file, X-Symbol mode is automatically turned on.  It is controlled by:

`x-symbol-texi-modes'
`x-symbol-texi-auto-style'
     The variables known from *Note Minor Mode::.  There is no automatic
     deduction of the file encoding, 8bit characters are usually
     encoded, and there is usually no unique decoding.  *Note
     Conversion::.

   With `x-symbol-8bits' having value `nil' (the default), it might
still happen that the saved file contains 8bit characters, since token
language `texi' does not define tokens for all characters in the Latin
charsets supported by X-Symbol.  *Note Controlling 8bit Coding::.

   With `x-symbol-unique' having value `nil' (the default), we have
unique decoding anyway, since token language `texi' does only define
one token per character, i.e., the value is not important if
`x-symbol-8bits' is `nil'.  *Note Unique Decoding::.

   The input methods and the character info in the echo area are
controlled by:

`x-symbol-texi-header-groups-alist'
     Defines the headers and their characters for the language specific
     Grid and Menu.

`x-symbol-texi-extra-menu-items'
     There are no special entries in the X-Symbol menu.

`x-symbol-texi-electric-ignore'
     There is no additional constraint to the ones mentioned in *Note
     Input Method Electric::.

`x-symbol-texi-class-alist'
`x-symbol-texi-class-face-alist'
     Only a few token classes (*note Char Group::.) are defined, the
     most interesting induces the character info (*note Info::.) to
     display `not as code' for `@minus{}' (`@minus{}' should not used
     inside `@code' and `@example').  No coloring scheme is defined.

   At least with `makeinfo-4.0', you do not get accented characters in
the info file for the corresponding TeXinfo commands in the `.texi'
file, the HTML output might contain illegal "SGML entities" like
`&140;'.

   At least with `texi2html-1.62', you see accented characters in the
HTML output for the corresponding TeXinfo commands in the `.texi' file,
but the output might also contain illegal "SGML entities" like `&140;'.

   You might want change the conversion between characters and tokens in
language `texi' by changing:

`x-symbol-texi-user-table'
     Extra entries for the conversion.

Internal Representation of X-Symbol Characters
==============================================

   As mentioned in *Note Pseudo Language::, most functions do not
operate on X-Symbol characters directly, they use "x-symbol charsyms".
These charsyms have a symbol property `x-symbol-cstring' which points to
a string, called "cstring", containing the X-Symbol character.

   * Under Emacs and XEmacs/Mule, the string only contains the character
     which is a normal Mule character created by `make-char'.

   * Under XEmacs/no-Mule, the string only contains the 8bit character
     if the X-Symbol character is a 8bit character according to
     `x-symbol-default-coding' (*note Default Coding::.).  Otherwise,
     the string contains of a "leading character" (with range `\200' to
     `\237') and an "octet".  Package `font-lock' is used to display
     them correctly as X-Symbol characters (*note FAQ Strange
     Chars::.).  E.g., with `\251' is `copyright', we get

          (get 'Idotaccent 'x-symbol-cstring)
               => "\235\251"

   If the character is also a 8bit character in some encoding (*note
File Coding::.), the charsym also has the symbol property
`x-symbol-file-cstrings' for the representation in the file and
property `x-symbol-buffer-cstrings' to recognize character aliases
(*note Char Aliases::.).  E.g., under XEmacs/no-Mule, with `\335' is
`Yacute', `\251' is `copyright', we get

     (get 'Idotaccent 'x-symbol-file-cstrings)
          => (iso-8859-9 "\335" iso-8859-3 "\251")
     (get 'Idotaccent 'x-symbol-buffer-cstrings)
          => (iso-8859-9 "\234\335" iso-8859-3 "\235\251")

   The values are plists (*note Property Lists: (lispref)Property
Lists.) mapping the file coding to the strings in the file or the
buffer, respectively.

   After token languages have been initialized, the charsym also has the
symbol properties `x-symbol-tokens' (*note Token Language::.) and
`x-symbol-classes' (*note Char Group::.):

     (get 'Idotaccent 'x-symbol-tokens)
          => (sgml "&#304;" tex "{\\.I}")
     (get 'Idotaccent 'x-symbol-classes)
          => (sgml (non-l1) tex (text aletter))

Defining X-Symbol Charsets
==========================

   An X-Symbol charset, called "cset" in the code and the docstrings,
handles one font used by package X-Symbol.  Each cset must use the same
char registry-encoding as the corresponding variables for the fonts
(*note Installing Fonts Lisp::.).

   You have to tell X-Symbol, how to define Mule charsets with Emacs or
XEmacs/Mule and which leading character to use with XEmacs/no-Mule.  As
an example, we use the definition of the Adobe symbol font.

     (defvar x-symbol-xsymb0-cset
       '((("adobe-fontspecific") ?\233 -3600)
         (xsymb0-left  "X-Symbol characters 0, left"  94 ?:) .
         (xsymb0-right "X-Symbol characters 0, right" 94 ?\;)))

   Mule charsets (*note Charsets: (lispref)Charsets.)  may be used for
94 or 96 characters (this example: 94, only charset with dimension 1
can be defined with X-Symbol).  Thus, if your font provides more
characters, you are likely to use both the left and the right half of
the font to define two Mule charsets.  For both of them, you have to
define a unique, free final character/byte of the standard ISO 2022
escape sequence designating the charset (this example: `:' and `;').
The remaining free (reserved by Emacs for users) are `>' and `?', the
latter is already used in XEmacs.

   For XEmacs/no-Mule, you have to define the leading character (this
example: `\233').

`x-symbol-latin2-cset'
`x-symbol-latin3-cset'
`x-symbol-latin5-cset'
     Cset definitions only using the upper halves of the fonts where the
     corresponding Mule charsets are known and which define characters
     which are considered 8bit characters in the corresponding
     encoding, see *Note File Coding::.

File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Input Method Objectives,  Next: Intro Char Descriptions,  Prev: Defining Input Methods,  Up: Defining Input Methods

Defining Input Methods: Objectives
----------------------------------

   Input methods should be intuitive.  This requires consistency:

   * Characters should be found under the same header in the Grid and
     in the Menu.

   * If one character can be modified or rotated to another character
     (*note Input Method Context::.), both should stand near to each
     other in the Grid.  E.g., since `arrowsouthwest' rotates to
     `arrowdown', they stand next to each other.

   * The key binding should be similar to the context of input method
     Context.  If two characters are defined to have the same context,
     they should have the same key prefix and the suffix should be a
     number which increases with the "modify-to" behavior.  E.g.,
     `reflexsubset' with key binding `C-= < _ 2' modifies to
     `reflexsqsubset' with key binding `C-= < _ 3'.

   * Consistent definition of "modify-to" and "rotate-to": if A can be
     modified to B and rotated to C and C can be modified to D, B can be
     rotated to D in most cases.

   * It should be possible to load character definitions later on,
     e.g., when new token languages get initialized.

        - Existing key bindings should not be overwritten.  If some of
          them have to change, it should be done in a uniform way
          (solution: key suffix `1').

        - Also, modifying or rotating a new character to/from old ones
          should be possible without changing the input definitions of
          the old characters.

   Observation: It is impossible, especially with the possibility to
load character definitions later on, to define the input methods
directly, i.e., by something like `define-key'.  The solution is an
indirect definitions with "character descriptions".

X-Symbol Character Descriptions: Example
----------------------------------------

   As an example for "character descriptions", look at the definition of
`longarrowright' in `x-symbol-xsymb1-table' (`95' is the encoding in
the font and not of interest here).  Some terms are defined in the next
section:

     (longarrowright 95
      (arrow) (size big . arrowright) nil ("->" t "-->") (emdash))

   With this definition, package X-Symbol automatically defines:

   * Key bindings `C-= - - >' and `C-= - > 2', the latter has suffix 2,
     because `C-= - >' is also "wanted" by `arrowright' which now has
     the key binding `C-= - > 1' (the "score" of `longarrowright' is
     higher, due to `size big').  *Note Input Method Keyboard::.

   * `arrowright' modifies to `longarrowright', which modifies to
     `arrowright'.  *Note Input Method Context::.

   * `longarrowleft' rotates to `longarrowright', which rotates to
     `longarrowboth' (which rotates to `longarrowleft').  (The "rotate
     aspects" are inherited from `arrowright'.)  *Note Input Method
     Context::.

   * The following contexts can be modified to `longarrowright': `-->'
     or `minus1' / `endash' / `macron' / `emdash' / `hyphen' and `->'
     (since all define context `-') and `emdash' and `>' (since
     `emdash' defines context `--').  `->' is used for `arrowright',
     which has a lower score, see above.  *Note Input Method Context::.

   * Input method Electric will change context `-->' (is tagged with
     `t' in the definition) to `longarrowright', also `emdash' and `>'
     (only theoretically, since input method Electric will produce
     `emdash' only in TeX's text mode, and `longarrowright' only in
     TeX's math mode).  *Note Input Method Electric::.

   * The character will appear in the Grid under the header `Arrow'.
     You will probably recognize that the placement is based on the
     modify-to and rotate-to behavior above.  *Note Input Method Grid::.

   * The character will appear in the Menu under one of the headers
     `Arrow N'".  The submenus are sorted alphabetically.  *Note Input
     Method Menu::.

   Consider that this character would be missing in package X-Symbol and
you want to define your own character (in your own font).  With the
current scheme, the one line above is enough!  Have fun defining all the
consequences directly instead....


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Char Descriptions,  Next: Example Char Descriptions,  Prev: Intro Char Descriptions,  Up: Defining Input Methods

Defining Input Methods by Character Descriptions
------------------------------------------------

   Characters are defined with "character descriptions" which consist
of different "aspects" and "contexts", which can also be inherited from
a "parent" character.  All characters which are connected with parents,
form a "component".  Aspects and contexts are used to determine the
modify-to and rotate-to chain for characters, the contexts for input
method Context and Electric, the key bindings, and the position in the
Menu and the Grid.

   If you want to check the component, scores, etc of a specific
character, look at the symbol property (e.g., with `M-x
hyper-apropos-get-doc') of the corresponding charsym, e.g.,
`arrowright'.  See also the docstrings of `x-symbol-init-cset' and
`x-symbol-init-input'.

   Remember, all characters which are connected with parents, form a
component.  "Contexts" are the contexts of input method Context (*note
Input Method Context::.).  If a table entry of a charsym does not
define its own contexts, they are the same as the contexts of the
charsym in an earlier position in the modify chain (see below), or the
contexts of the first charsym with defined contexts in the modify chain.
The "modify context" of a charsym is the first context.

`x-symbol-rotate-aspects-alist'
     Characters in the same component whose aspects only differ by their
     `direction' (`east',...), a key in this alist, are circularly
     connected by "rotate-to".  The sequence in the "rotate chain" is
     determined by "rotate scores" depending on the values in the
     "rotate aspects".  Charsyms with the same "rotate-aspects" are not
     connected (charsyms with the smallest modify scores are preferred).

          (get 'longarrowright 'x-symbol-rotate-aspects)
               => (-1500 direction east)

`x-symbol-modify-aspects-alist'
     Characters in the same components whose aspects only differ by
     their `size' (`big',...), `shape' (`round', `square'...) and/or
     `shift' (`up', `down',...), keys in this alist, are circularly
     connected by "modify-to", if all their modify contexts are used
     exclusively, i.e., no other modify chain uses any of them.  The
     sequence in the "modify chain" is determined by "modify scores"
     depending on the values in the "modify aspects", the charsym score
     defined in the definition tables and the score of the whole cset
     (*note Defining Charsets::.).

          (get 'longarrowright 'x-symbol-score)
               => -3500
          (get 'longarrowright 'x-symbol-modify-aspects)
               => (1500 shift nil shape nil size big)

     Otherwise, the "modify chain" is divided into modify subchains,
     which are those charsyms sharing the same modify context.  All
     modify subchains using the same modify context, build a
     "horizontal chain" whose charsyms are circularly connected by
     "modify-to".

     We build a "key chain" for all contexts (not just modify contexts),
     consisting of all charsyms (sorted according to modify scores)
     having the context.  Input method Context modifies the context to
     the first charsym in the key chain.

`x-symbol-key-suffix-string'
     If there is only one charsym in the key chain, `C-=' plus the
     context inserts the charsym.  Otherwise, we determine a suffix for
     each charsym in the key chain by its index and this string.  `C-='
     plus the context plus the suffix inserts the charsym.

     --------------------------------------------------------------
     charsym 1w    150     nil     100     west    `a'      `c'
     charsym 2w    200     nil     100     west    `b'       -
     charsym 3w    350     big     100     west   (`b')     (-)
     charsym 1e    100     nil     200     east   (`a')    (`b')
     charsym 2e    250     big     200     east    `a'      `b'
     charsym 3e    300     big     200     east    `a'       -
     charsym 1n    100     nil     300     north   `d'      `c'
     charsym 2n    200     big     300     north   `c'       -

   Assuming that all charsyms form one component, we have:

     Rotate chains:     (1w,2w)-1e-1n and 3w-(2e,3e)-2n.
     Modify chains:     1w-2w-3w and 1e-2w-3w and 1n-2n.
     Horizontal chains: 1e-1w-2e-3e       (for modify context `a')
                        2w-3w             (for modify context `b')
     Key chains:        1e-1w-2e-3e       (for context `a')
                        1e-2w-2e-3w       (for context `b')
                        1n-1w-2n          (for context `c')
                        1n                (for context `d')

   That makes the following bindings:

     Rotate-to: 1w->1e, 2w->1e, 1e->1n, 1n->1w
                3w->2e, 2e->2n, 3e->2n, 2n->3w
     Modify-to: 1e->1w, 1w->2e, 2e->3e, 3e->1e     (horizontal chain)
                2w->3w, 3w->2w                     (horizontal chain)
                1n->2n, 2n->1n  (modify chain with exclusive modify contexts)
     CONTEXTS:  `a'->1e, `b'->1e, `c'->1n, `d'->1n
     KEY:       `a1'=1e, `a2'=1w, `a3'=2e, `a4'=3e, `b1'=1e, ..., `d'=1n

Customizing Input Methods
-------------------------

   When defining contexts for characters, you should try to use default
contexts to make them and key bindings as consistent as possible.  E.g.,
package X-Symbol only defines explicit contexts for 186 of the 437
characters.

`x-symbol-group-input-alist'
     Defines default scores and bindings for characters of a group
     (*note Char Group::.).  E.g., the definition (in
     `x-symbol-latin1-table')

          (aacute 225 (acute "a" Aacute))

     defines `aacute' without any explicit contexts, but having the
     group `acute' and the subgroup `a'.  The default input for the
     group is defined by the following element in this variable:

          (acute 0 "%s'" t "'%s")

     That means: 0 is added to the normal "modify-score" of the
     character.  `%s'' and `'%s' with `%s' substituted by the subgroup,
     i.e., `a'' and `'a', are the contexts for `aacute'.  The context
     `'a' is also used for input method Electric since it is prefixed
     by `t'.

`x-symbol-key-min-length'
     It is quite unlikely that a one-character context is not the
     prefix of another context, at least when loading additional font
     definitions.  In order not to have to change key bindings `C-=
     KEY' to `C-= KEY 1', it is required that the length of the key
     binding without `C-=' is at least 2.

Extending Package X-Symbol
==========================

   In this section, you are told what to consider and what to do when
extending package X-Symbol with new characters and new token languages.
If you only want to define a token language using existing characters,
you only have to read the last section.

Extending X-Symbol with New Fonts
---------------------------------

   If you add a new token language to package X-Symbol which should
represent tokens by characters which are not yet defined by package
X-Symbol, you have to add a new font to package X-Symbol, first.

   When adding new fonts to package X-Symbol, consider that X-Symbol
has to run under Emacs, XEmacs/Mule and XEmacs/no-Mule.

   Running under Emacs and XEmacs/Mule requires that you cannot use all
encodings in a font for characters: you should probably only use
encodings 33 to 126 and 160 to 255.  You should also use a unique pair
of charset properties `CHARSET_REGISTRY' and `CHARSET_ENCODING'.

   Running under XEmacs/no-Mule can leads to problems when major modes
do not check whether the previous character is an escape character (in
our case, a leading character, *note Char Representation::.) when
looking at a character.  Thus, you should probably not use encodings
which represent characters in your default font with a special syntax.

   * In LaTeX buffers, characters in `$%\{}' have a special syntax.
     Thus, you should you should probably not use encodings 36, 37, 92,
     123 and 125 for characters which could also be useful with token
     languages `tex' and `utex'.

   * In HTML buffers, characters in `&<>' have a special syntax.  Thus,
     you should you should probably not use encodings 38, 60 and 62 for
     characters which could also be useful with token language `sgml'.

   You have to tell package X-Symbol which fonts to use for the normal
text, subscripts and superscripts.  *Note Installing Fonts Lisp::.

   You have to tell X-Symbol, how to define Mule charsets with Emacs and
XEmacs/Mule and which leading character to use with XEmacs/no-Mule.
*Note Defining Charsets::.

Guidelines for Input Definitions
--------------------------------

   Read section *Note Defining Input Methods::.  Look at the tables in
`x-symbol.el'.  Here are some guidelines of how to define the input
methods for new characters:

  1. Define reasonable character groups for new characters, see *Note
     Char Group::.  E.g., if you add the IPA font for phonetic
     characters, you are likely to define at least one additional
     charset group.  If you do not know whether to use one or two
     groups for a set of characters, use two.

  2. Define under which Grid/Menu header the character of the new
     character group should appear.  You may also want to add
     additional headers for these characters.  *Note Char Group::.

  3. If reasonable, define default contexts for characters of a group,
     see *Note Customizing Input Methods::.

  4. For the other characters, define contexts by Ascii sequences which
     look similar to the character.

  5. Form a component for a set of characters which are strongly
     related to each other.  In most cases, characters of a component
     are in the same group but not vice versa.  E.g., the simple arrows
     already defined by package X-Symbol form one component.  You form
     a component of characters by specifying parents in their
     definition, see *Note Char Descriptions::.

  6. Use aspects to describe the new characters.  Add new aspects to
     `x-symbol-modify-aspects-alist' and
     `x-symbol-rotate-aspects-alist' if necessary (*note Char
     Descriptions::.).

  7. Finish the definition of your font file (*note Font Definition
     File::.), load it with `M-x load-file', and initialize the input
     methods, e.g., by invoking the grid (`M-x x-symbol-grid').

  8. If there are no errors, you are likely to get warnings about equal
     modify scores.  In this case, the sequence of characters in the
     modify-to chain is random, so are the numerical suffixes of key
     bindings.

       a. Define a base score for the whole X-Symbol charset ("cset
          score") which should be a positive number in order not to
          change the key bindings of previously defined X-Symbol
          characters.

       b. Define reasonable scores for newly defined aspects and
          character groups.

       c. Finally, fine-tune your definitions by charsym scores in the
          tables.  This should be necessary only for a few characters.

Emacs Lisp File Defining a New Font
-----------------------------------

   Now put all things together in a separate font definition file.  You
should not put it in a language definition file.

   Here is a tiny example using only the lower half of the font:

     (provide 'x-symbol-myfont)
     (defvar x-symbol-myfont-fonts
       '(("-xsymb-myfont-medium-r-normal--14-140-75-75-p-85-xsymb-myfont")
         ("-xsymb-myfont_sub-medium-r-normal--12-120-75-75-p-74-xsymb-myfont")
         ("-xsymb-myfont_sup-medium-r-normal--12-120-75-75-p-74-xsymb-myfont")))

     (defvar x-symbol-myfont-cset
       '((("xsymb-myfont") ?\200 1000)
         (myfont-left "My font characters, left"  94 63) . nil))

     (defvar x-symbol-myfont-table
       '((longarrownortheast 33 (arrow) (size big . arrownortheast))
         (koerper 34 (setsymbol "K"))
         (circleS 35 (symbol "S") nil nil "SO")))

     (x-symbol-init-cset x-symbol-myfont-cset x-symbol-myfont-fonts
     		      x-symbol-myfont-table)

   Due to an XEmacs bug with char syntax `inherit', you should also add
the following line to files `x-symbol-xmas20.el' and
`x-symbol-xmas21.el':

       (modify-syntax-entry ?\200 "\\" (standard-syntax-table))


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Language Extension File,  Next: Language Definition File,  Prev: Font Definition File,  Up: Extending X-Symbol

Emacs Lisp File Extending a Token Language
------------------------------------------

   If you want to use the new font to extend an existing token language,
define a new token language which inherits most variables from the
"parent language".  E.g., token language `utex' inherits most variables
from `tex', see `x-symbol-utex.el'.

   A language must define variables for all language aspects, see *Note
Language Internals::.  Our example defines a language `mytex' using the
additional characters from *Note Font Definition File::.

   First, you have to register the language in a startup file:

     (defvar x-symbol-mytex-name "My TeX macro")
     (defvar x-symbol-mytex-modes nil)
     (x-symbol-register-language 'mytex 'x-symbol-mytex x-symbol-mytex-modes)

   The language definition file should look like (leaving out most parts
which are similar to the ones in `x-symbol-utex.el'):

     (provide 'x-symbol-mytex)
     (require 'x-symbol-tex)
     (defvar x-symbol-mytex-required-fonts '(x-symbol-myfont))
     (put 'mytex 'x-symbol-font-lock-keywords 'x-symbol-tex-font-lock-keywords)

     (defvar x-symbol-mytex-user-table nil)
     (defvar x-symbol-mytex-myfont-table
       '((longarrownortheast (math arrow user) "\\longnortheastarrow")
         (koerper (math letter user) "\\setK")
         (circleS (math ordinary amssymb) "\\circledS")))

     (defvar x-symbol-mytex-table
       (append x-symbol-mytex-user-table
               '(nil)
               x-symbol-mytex-myfont-table
               x-symbol-tex-table))

   It is important that you do not define a variable for the language
access `x-symbol-font-lock-keywords', but rather use the variable of
the parent language directly, see *Note Language Internals::.

   During the testing phase, you should probably leave out the `'(nil)'
which prevents warnings about redefinitions for the following elements.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Language Definition File,  Prev: Language Extension File,  Up: Extending X-Symbol

Emacs Lisp File Defining a New Token Language
---------------------------------------------

   You might also want to define a new token language not based on
another language.

   As an example, consider a token language "My Unicode" (`myuc') for
buffers with major mode `myuc-mode'.  Thus, we register the language by:

     (defvar x-symbol-myuc-name "My Unicode")
     (defvar x-symbol-myuc-modes '(myuc-mode))
     (x-symbol-register-language 'myuc 'x-symbol-myuc x-symbol-myuc-modes)

   Each token if language `myuc' consists of `#' plus the hexadecimal
representation of the Unicode with hexadecimal values where the case of
digits is not important and the preferred case is upcase.  A single `#'
is represented by the token `##'.  In order to be more flexible, we
want to define the tokens by their decimal value in the table.  There
are no subscript and no images.  The code below (`x-symbol-myuc.el') is
included in the source distribution of package X-Symbol.

     (provide 'x-symbol-myuc)
     (defvar x-symbol-myuc-required-fonts nil)
     (defvar x-symbol-myuc-modeline-name "myuc")
     (defvar x-symbol-myuc-class-alist
       '((VALID "My Unicode" (x-symbol-info-face))
         (INVALID "no My Unicode" (red x-symbol-info-face))))
     (defvar x-symbol-myuc-font-lock-keywords nil)
     (defvar x-symbol-myuc-image-keywords nil)

Tagging Insert Commands for Token and Electric
----------------------------------------------

   Input methods Token (*note Input Method Token::.) and Electric
(*note Input Method Electric::.) stop their auto replacement if you use
a command which is not an insert command.

`self-insert-command'
`newline'
`newline-and-indent'
`reindent-then-newline-and-indent'
`tex-insert-quote'
`TeX-insert-quote'
`TeX-insert-punctuation'
`TeX-insert-dollar'
`sgml-close-angle'
`sgml-slash'
     These commands and commands aliased to these are recognized as
     input commands by having a non-`nil' value of its symbol property
     `x-symbol-input'.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Avoiding Flickering,  Prev: Tagging Insert Commands,  Up: Various Internals

Avoiding Hide/Show-Invisible Flickering
---------------------------------------

   Starting a command makes a previously revealed super- or subscript
command (*note Super and Subscripts::.) invisible again.  Repeatedly
invoking commands which moves the point just by a small amount can lead
to some flickering.

`forward-char'
`forward-char-command'
`backward-char'
`backward-char-command'
     If the point position after the execution of these commands is
     still "at" the super- or subscript command, the command won't be
     made invisible at the first place.  Each of these four commands
     have a function (`1+' and `1-') as the value of its symbol property
     `x-symbol-point-function' which returns the position "after" when
     called with the position "before".

File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Alt Token Representations,  Next: Alt Global Mode,  Prev: Design Alternatives,  Up: Design Alternatives

Alternative Token Representations
---------------------------------

   Package X-Symbol represents tokens in the file by characters in the
buffer.  This requires an automatic conversion when visiting a file or
saving a buffer, see *Note Conversion::.

   Another possibility would be to use the tokens directly in the buffer
and just display them differently.  You would need no conversion and you
could copy the text easily to a message buffer.  This could be done by a
special face and an additional font-lock keyword for every token.  The
disadvantages make this approach unfeasible:

   * The editing commands would work on the tokens which are invisible
     for the user.

   * Extremely resource and startup-time consuming.  If as many
     characters should be supported as done by package X-Symbol,
     including superscripts and subscripts, more than 2000 faces with
     display tables would have to be defined even without considering
     char aliases!

   * Time consuming.  More than 2000 entries in you font-lock keywords
     would slow down the fontification considerably, which would be too
     much even when using `lazy-shot'!

   Another possibility would be to adapt TeX to the representations of
the corresponding characters in Emacs' buffer.  Again, you would need no
conversion.  The disadvantages make this approach too restrictive:

   * You cannot adopt SGML to this approach.

   * You cannot read normal LaTeX files directly, you do not write
     normal LaTeX files.

   * You would have different TeX versions: one for X-Symbol with Emacs
     and XEmacs/Mule, one with XEmacs/no-Mule.

   * If you are not an extremely good TeX hacker, it would be impossible
     to adopt this approach to support more than 256 characters.

   A third alternative would be very similar to the method used in this
package.  There would be just a slight difference when running under
XEmacs/no-Mule: the internal representation of a character is always
just one character, but we would also provide font properties for
characters not of your default font.  The disadvantages make this
approach too unsafe:

   * Problems with current search/replace commands.

   * Problems with the current version of `font-lock' (it should *never*
     overwrite the font property for this character, even if the
     character matches some MATCH in `font-lock-keywords' and OVERWRITE
     is non-`nil').  This gets even more difficult with
     superscripts/subscripts.

   * Unless you can provide a syntax table for faces (you cannot),
     characters in different faces with the same encoding are in the
     same syntax class, which is irritating: e.g., `\leftrightarrow'
     and `\approx' would be delimiters.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Alt Global Mode,  Next: Alt Auto Conversion,  Prev: Alt Token Representations,  Up: Design Alternatives

Alternative Ways to Turn on X-Symbol Globally
---------------------------------------------

   This package hooks itself into `hack-local-variables-hook' which
makes the installation very simple.

   Another possibility would be to use the major-mode hooks which is the
normal way how to turn on a minor mode.  The disadvantages are:

   * The installation is more complicated.

   * Local variables in files are not yet processed (this was the main
     reason not to do it this way).

   Another possibility would be to hook X-Symbol into
`find-file-hooks', as it is done in old versions of package X-Symbol.
It would be as easy as the current approach but we would have to be
careful with sequence of functions in `find-file-hooks', especially
with the function hooked in by `font-lock'.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Alt Auto Conversion,  Prev: Alt Global Mode,  Up: Design Alternatives

Alternative Auto Conversion Methods
-----------------------------------

   Without package `crypt', this package automatically decodes tokens
when turning on the minor mode (in `hack-local-variables-hook', *note
Alt Global Mode::.) or in `after-insert-file-functions'.  This package
automatically encodes characters in `write-region-annotate-functions'.
The disadvantage is that the possibility to change buffers in
`write-region-annotate-functions' is not official (*note Wishlist
Emacs::.), i.e., not mentioned in the docstring (only mentioned for
corresponding encode-functions of package `format' which use a similar
loop in the C code).

   With package `crypt', this package automatically decodes tokens when
turning on the minor mode.  This package automatically encodes
characters in `write-file-hooks'.  The disadvantage is that the
encoding is slower (use `jka-compr' instead `crypt') and the problem
with `vc-next-action' (*note Spurious Encodings::.).

   Without package `crypt', Version 2.6 of this package automatically
encoded characters in `write-file-data-hooks'.  The advantage was that
changing buffers there is official, the disadvantage is that it is also
more complicated.

   A totally different method would be to use package `format'.
Unfortunately, this is not really possible, since a REGEXP in
`format-alist' is much too weak, i.e., X-Symbol's decoding does not
change any file headers which would represent the file format.  In
XEmacs, this package also fails to work properly with `jka-compr' and
`crypt'.

Language Internals
==================

   In order to use a token language or accessing one of the language
dependent values, the following conditions must be met:

   * The language must be "registered".  This makes it possible to
     select the language in the menus.  It also prevents to load a
     potentially dangerous file when a file specifies a buffer-local
     value of `x-symbol-language'.

    `x-symbol-register-language'
          Registering a language includes stating the name of the
          feature (i.e., a file) which provides the language.  The name
          of the language must have been already defined.

   * The file providing the language must have been "loaded".  This will
     be done automatically when the language is initialized.
     Customizing X-Symbol will also load the language files.

   * The language must be "initialized".  This will be done
     automatically if the language is used.  This loads the language
     file and fails if the language has not been registered.  If some
     minor language information is needed, e.g., in the highlight menu
     of the Grid (*note Input Method Grid::.), you should initialize
     the language explicitly, e.g., by the following command:

    `M-x x-symbol-init-language-interactive'
          Initialized a token language if it is not already initialized.

   Language dependent values are accessed by language accesses:

`x-symbol-language-value'
     Returns the language depending value.  Also initializes language if
     necessary.  E.g., we get the name of a language by the language
     access `x-symbol-name'.  With a simplified expansion, we get

          (x-symbol-language-value 'x-symbol-name 'tex)
               ==> (symbol-value (get 'tex 'x-symbol-name))
               => (symbol-value 'x-symbol-tex-name)
               => "TeX macro"

`x-symbol-language-access-alist'
     List of all language accesses.  A token language *must* define all
     variables accessed by language accesses.  A "language access" is a
     property of the language symbol, its value is the symbol naming a
     variable whose value is used.

     If the language is a derived language, e.g., like language `utex',
     the language access `x-symbol-font-lock-keywords', should point
     directly to the variable of the parent language (here `tex'), see
     file `x-symbol-utex.el'.

Miscellaneous Internals
=======================

   TODO.  This is currently just a collection of unrelated stuff.

   Characters might also define a "subgroup" which is a string defining
some order on characters in the same group (*note Char Group::.) and is
also used for default contexts/bindings (*note Customizing Input
Methods::.).

`x-symbol-group-syntax-alist'
     Lists all valid character groups.  Under Emacs and XEmacs/Mule,
     this list also determines the syntax of characters.

   The character group could probably also be used to define character
categories if they are implemented in XEmacs.

Problems under XEmacs/no-Mule
=============================

   If you use package X-Symbol under XEmacs/no-Mule, there are some
annoyances which result from the fact that additional "X-Symbol
characters" are represented by two characters internally.  Package
X-Symbol just provides a kind of "*poor* man's Mule", see *Note Poor
Mans Mule::.  This means: I have provided workarounds for the most
annoying ones, but some remain (and will remain: I am not going to
provide workarounds for these):

   * If `font-lock' is not prepared to display these two-character
     sequences, i.e., if you installation is incomplete (*note Role of
     font-lock::.), they look like `\233a' instead `alpha'.

   * Commands which add more than one entry to the `buffer-undo-list'
     and involve X-Symbol characters might lead to strange results,
     e.g. `C-t' (`transpose-chars') with point between character
     `alpha' and `b', leads to `beta'`a'.  Simple deletion and
     insertion works OK, though.

   * Selecting or inserting a rectangle with X-Symbol characters on the
     left or right margin might not work properly.

   * Be careful with `M-%' (`query-replace'): the first character of
     FROM-STRING can probably match the second of the two "internal"
     characters of an X-Symbol character.

   * If you use `C-x '' (`expand-abbrev') without `M-''
     (`abbrev-prefix-mark') and the last word before point starts
     directly after a X-Symbol character, `C-x '' could behave strange:

        - If `words-include-escapes' is `t', there will be no expansion.

        - If `words-include-escapes' is `nil', the second "internal"
          character could be the first character of the last word
          before point which is going to be replaced by the abbrev
          mechanism.

   * If the character under point is a X-Symbol character, you will not
     see the cursor if you exit a command with an error or with quit
     (`C-g').  Unfortunately, XEmacs (as opposed to Emacs) does not run
     the hooks in `post-command-hook' in these cases.  Solution: move
     point right (`C-f').

   * If you provide prefix arguments to commands, they are likely to
     consider just "internal" characters.  E.g., `C-u 2 C-f' before
     `alpha' behaves like `C-f'.

   * Column position considers "internal" characters, e.g., `C-n' might
     jump to an unexpected position (well, typically just one character
     left/right from the expected position, if at all).

   * Auto-filling also considers "internal" characters, i.e., might
     break the line too early.

   * There are no syntax definitions for the new characters, e.g.,
     `M-C-f' before `floorleft' does not move to the closing
     `floorright'.

   * In some cases, e.g., when using the minibuffer for input via `M-%'
     or `C-s', the internal representation of X-Symbol characters
     (*note Char Representation::.) are displayed directly (*note FAQ
     Strange Chars::.)


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Spurious Encodings,  Next: No Encoding,  Prev: Nomule Problems,  Up: Problems

Spurious Encodings
==================

   In rare cases, some commands (mostly from package `vc') encode
characters to tokens or even turn off X-Symbol mode.  Package X-Symbol
will not provide a workaround for these problems, because the situations
in which they appear are too rare, the workarounds are easy, and the
problems are not really caused by package X-Symbol.

   * Doing the next logical version control operation (`C-x v v' and
     friends) encode characters to tokens when using package `crypt'.

     Solution: use package `jka-compr' instead `crypt' (this is
     recommended anyway, *note File IO Packages::.).  Or kill the
     buffer and revisit the file.

   * When using AucTeX with its default-mode algorithm, getting rid of
     the recently checked-in version of a file without reverting the
     buffer afterwards (`C-u C-x v c') turns off X-Symbol mode without
     encoding the characters, e.g. under XEmacs/no-Mule, you see some
     strange characters like `\233a'.

     Explanation: when using AucTeX's `TeX-default-mode', the final
     `major-mode' is different from the initial `major-mode' deduced
     using `auto-mode-alist'.  If this is the case, the VC command
     executes `normal-mode' which kills all local-variables including
     turning-off `x-symbol-mode'.

     Solution: Turn on X-Symbol mode or change `auto-mode-alist' to
     directly choose `latex-mode':

          (push '("\\[tT]e[xX]\\'" . latex-mode) auto-mode-alist)

   * When using AucTeX with its default-mode algorithm, writing a LaTeX
     buffer into a file with another file name turns off X-Symbol mode.

     Explanation: Emacs sets the major mode with the file name.  When
     using AucTeX's `TeX-default-mode', we get the problems as
     described in the previous item.

     Solution: Set `change-major-mode-with-file-name' to `nil' or use
     the solution from the previous item.

The Encoding Does Not Work
==========================

   In a rare case, X-Symbol cannot do its encoding, i.e., convert the
characters to tokens.

   * `M-x write-region' fails to do the encoding if you use package
     `crypt'.

     Explanation: with package `crypt', the encoding has to be done by a
     function in `write-file-hooks' which is not used by `write-region'.

     Solution: use package `jka-compr' instead `crypt' (this is
     recommended anyway, *note File IO Packages::.).  Or visit the
     region file and save it again via `C-x C-s'.

XEmacs Crashes when using Input Method Token
--------------------------------------------

   It has been reported that XEmacs-21.0 to XEmacs-21.1.8 might produce
cores when you use input method Token.  That's why I strongly recommend
to use XEmacs-21.1.9 or higher with package X-Symbol, see *Note
Requirements::.

   You get a warning during X-Symbol's initialization when using these
XEmacs versions.  If you don't want to upgrade, but also don't want to
see the warning, you might want to set variable
`x-symbol-xmas-warn-about-core' to `nil'.

   A core in XEmacs always indicates a bug in XEmacs itself, not in a
Lisp package like X-Symbol.  Thus, send a bug report to the XEmacs team
if you get cores with the *newest* version of XEmacs (please put me in
the CC).

X-Symbol's Fontification does Not Work
--------------------------------------

   In this case, super- and subscripts are not properly displayed
(*note FAQ No Subscripts::.) and under XEmacs/no-Mule, the buffer
contains s.th. like `\233a' (*note FAQ Strange Chars::.).  Possible
causes:

   * You have turned off `font-lock' or `font-lock' is out of sync.
     Use `M-x x-symbol-fontify'.  *Note Role of font-lock::.

   * The font-lock keywords of the current buffer are not prepared to
     display X-Symbol characters.  *Note Role of font-lock::.

   * You use package `fast-lock'.  Solution: set `fast-lock-save-faces'
     to `nil' (done by default installation).

   * You use some version control commands.  You have probably noticed
     that these versions control commands also turn off `font-lock' in
     modes where you don't use X-Symbol, i.e., this is not a problem of
     package X-Symbol.  *note Wishlist Emacs::. and *Note Spurious
     Encodings::.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: FAQ Strange Chars,  Next: FAQ No Subscripts,  Prev: FAQ font-lock,  Up: FAQ

The Buffer Contains Strange Characters
--------------------------------------

   If you see s.th. like `\233a', you see the internal representation
of X-Symbol characters under XEmacs/no-Mule (*note Char
Representation::.) directly.  Possible causes:

   * You have `font-lock' problems, see *Note FAQ font-lock::.

   * More complicated editing commands like `C-t' may produce strange
     character sequences which do not represent X-Symbol characters, see
     *Note Nomule Problems::.

   * In some cases, e.g., when using the minibuffer for input via `M-%'
     or `C-s', it would be too much work to fontify these character
     sequences in order to display proper X-Symbol characters.  *Note
     Nomule Problems::.

   If Emacs shows some strange glyphs for some characters in your
buffers but not the Grid, there is a font in you font path which
pretends to have charset registry-encoding `adobe-fontspecific', but in
fact uses another encoding.  E.g., Mathematica's fonts cause the
characters intersection and union to mix up.  Possible solutions:

   * Delete that font from the font path.  Maybe moving it at the end
     also works.

   * In Emacs-21, you have the chance to disable the use of some fonts
     (if you know something similar for XEmacs, please let me know).
     For example, to disable the fonts from Mathematica, use

          (setq face-ignored-fonts '("\\`-wri-math1"))

   * If the characters show up correctly initially, but mix up after
     some font changing command, don't use that command.  E.g., the
     font selection in XEmacs via the Options menu seems to loose some
     information about the original font.  OK, this is not really a
     satisfying solution, but the whole issue isn't my fault, either.

I Cannot See any/some Super- or Subscripts
------------------------------------------

   If you cannot select `Super-/Subscripts' in the menu, the first of
the following points is more likely the cause, the others otherwise.

   * You have `font-lock' problems, see *Note FAQ font-lock::.

   * There are cases where super- and subscripts are not displayed, see
     *Note Super and Subscripts::.

   * The argument in braces are not correctly recognized, since the
     `font-lock' syntax-table is not correct.  It should include `{' as
     the only open parenthesis and `}' as the only close parenthesis
     character.  Note that this is quite difficult to archive under
     Emacs and XEmacs/Mule.  This is a minor bug in the corresponding
     `font-lock' package, but would require other changes there,
     therefore not likely to be fixed.  Fortunately, this does not
     happen often.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: FAQ Stupid Subscripts,  Next: FAQ Font Size,  Prev: FAQ No Subscripts,  Up: FAQ

I See Super- and Subscripts where I Don't Want Them.
----------------------------------------------------

   E.g., I see a subscript in arguments of `\label'.  Package X-Symbol
only uses super- and subscripts if they are in braces, if the
`asciicircum'/`underscore' has not been fontified yet or is only
fontified with faces which are allowed by
`x-symbol-tex-font-lock-allowed-faces', see *Note Super and
Subscripts::.

   * You use the default `tex-font-lock-keywords': The argument of
     `\include' and friends are not fontified by these, i.e., the use
     of super- and subscripts are not prohibited.  Solution: add your
     own keyword for these commands or use package `font-latex', see
     below.

   * You use package `font-latex'.  Solution: set
     `font-lock-maximum-decoration' to value `t', 2 or higher.  Package
     X-Symbol will still use subscripts in `\verb', in the `verbatim'
     environment, in the argument of `\includegraphics' and probably
     other commands.  Some of these problems will probably be solved by
     future versions of `font-latex'.

   * You use my font-lock keywords (file `x-font-lock.el'): everything
     should work fine.  Please note that this file is not meant to be a
     replacement of `font-latex.el' useful to all users.  Also,
     highlighting is a matter of taste, i.e., I am not going to change
     the `x-font-lock.el' to support LaTeX-2.09, TeX's math regions,
     other likings, etc.

   * You use your own font-lock keywords for TeX.  In this case, you be
     able to adapt the solutions from the previous points to your
     situation.

(or vice versa)?  Please convince yourself (*note Info::.) that you
actually get the correct letter--they are just of different sizes.
*Note Installing Fonts Lisp::.

   I was told that the xsymb1 font scales reasonably well to a larger
font size--if you don't think so, design a new font and send me the
result.

The Conversion Changes Some Tokens
----------------------------------

   In most token languages, a character might be represented by
different tokens.  If this character is encoded (when saving the
buffer), the canonical representation is saved.  *Note Unique
Decoding::.

   * Solution: Do not redefine standard TeX macros or use unique
     decoding.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: FAQ Additional Spaces,  Next: FAQ 8bit Chars,  Prev: FAQ Conversion,  Up: FAQ

A Space is Added During the Encoding
------------------------------------

   A space is added after some characters during the encoding to tokens.
With token languages `tex' and `utex' (not with language `sgml'), there
must be a space after the token to recognize its end in some cases.

   E.g., if your buffer contains `a+b' (where + stands for the
character `circleplus'), this is encoded to `a\oplus b' (note the space
after `\oplus').  Decoding it yields `a+ b'.

   I admit, this looks ugly.  The space is only added if the symbol
character is followed by a letter or by `@'.  Thus, decoding
`a\oplus\beta' yields `a+b' (without space!).

   * Suggestion: Also use a space before `\oplus'.  The alternative
     would be to delete the space which other people won't like.

   *Note TeX Macro Conversion:: for an exact description.

I Don't Want 8bit Characters in the File
----------------------------------------

   By default, these are not encoded if the buffer-local variable
`x-symbol-8bits' is non-`nil'.

   By default, this variable is only set to non-`nil', if something like

     \usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}

   is found at the beginning of the file.  That line does not make
sense if you do not have 8bit characters in the file, i.e., delete it.
*Note File Coding::.  Note: commenting the line is not enough!  (I do
not run LaTeX to check for the line, I just do plain text search.)

I Cannot Distinguish Character `hyphen' from `-'
------------------------------------------------

   In most fonts, the Latin character `hyphen' cannot be distinguish
from the Ascii character `-'.  If you do not want to decode the
corresponding token `\-' or `&shy;', put the following into your
`~/.emacs':

     (setq x-symbol-tex-user-table '((hyphen)))
     (setq x-symbol-sgml-user-table '((hyphen)))

   A better alternative would be to make `font-lock' display these
character in a different color.

Problems with Spell-checking
----------------------------

   As explained in *Note Miscellaneous Packages::, `ispell' assumes the
buffer contents to be the same as the file contents and does not provide
any hook to fix this.  This might break `ispell-word' and
`ispell-region'.  Possible symptoms:

   * A word which contains letters which the program `ispell' does not
     know about is either not spell-checked or parts of it are
     spell-checked as independent words.

     Solution: Use the `ispell's 8bit dictionaries even if you do not
     store 8bit characters in the file.  This should fix the problem for
     almost every word, except, e.g., words containing the Latin-9
     character `oe' if you use a Latin-1 encoding.

   * Spell-checking might stop with the error message `Ispell
     misalignment'.  I can reproduce this only with Emacs, not with
     XEmacs.

     Question: If you know some settings (like for
     `process-coding-system-alist') which solves this problem, please
     let me know!

     Solution: turn X-Symbol off before spell-checking your buffer.
     This is of course no option if you use `flyspell'.

   The real solution would be to fix `ispell', at least by providing a
useful hook which allows X-Symbol to fix the problem.  *Note Wishlist
Emacs::.  You are strongly encouraged to send a patch to the maintainer
of `ispell', you even get a paragraph here in *Note Acknowledgments::!

How to Use X-Symbol with Gnus or VM
-----------------------------------

   You can also use X-Symbol to read and write your News and Mails.
This sections includes coding for your `~/.emacs' if you want to do so.
It has been tested for GNUS-5.8.8 and VM-6.96; if you use RMAIL or
MH-E, you have to try to find a solution yourself (please send it to
me).  Support for GNUS might become a standard part of X-Symbol.

     (custom-set-variables
      '(x-symbol-auto-style-alist
        '(((mail-mode message-mode gnus-article-mode vm-presentation-mode)
           tex nil nil nil nil t nil))))

   This is optional (you might want to use the Custom interface for the
same effect) and tells Emacs/X-Symbol to use token language `tex' and
to display super-/subscripts (if `font-lock' is enabled), X-Symbol is
not automatically turned on.  *Note Minor Mode::.

     (defun x-symbol-x-mail-send-hook ()
       (if x-symbol-mode (x-symbol-mode 0)))
     (add-hook 'mail-send-hook 'x-symbol-x-mail-send-hook)
     (add-hook 'message-send-hook 'x-symbol-x-mail-send-hook)
     (add-hook 'vm-mail-send-hook 'x-symbol-x-mail-send-hook)

   This tells tells Emacs to automatically turn off X-Symbol (which
includes encoding characters to token) before actually sending the
message.

     (defun x-symbol-x-gnus-prepare ()
       (when x-symbol-mode
         (setq x-symbol-mode nil)
         (x-symbol-mode-internal nil)))
     (add-hook 'gnus-article-prepare-hook 'x-symbol-x-gnus-prepare)

   Since GNUS reuses the `*Article*' buffer, where X-Symbol could have
been turned on previously, we must make sure that X-Symbol is turned
off with the new article.

     (defun x-symbol-x-vm-prepare ()
       (and (boundp 'vm-presentation-buffer)
            (buffer-live-p vm-presentation-buffer)
            (save-excursion
     	 (set-buffer vm-presentation-buffer)
     	 (when x-symbol-mode
     	   (setq x-symbol-mode nil)
     	   (x-symbol-mode-internal nil)))))
     (add-hook 'vm-select-message-hook 'x-symbol-x-gnus-prepare)

   The same thing for VM, although the hook is not as nice as GNUS'
one; the function therefore might depend a bit too much on VM's interna.

     (put 'vm-mode 'x-symbol-mode-disable
          "Use VM Presentation Mode to turn on X-Symbol")
     (custom-set-variables '(vm-fill-paragraphs-containing-long-lines 80))

   You cannot use X-Symbol in VM Mode, only in VM Presentation Mode
(X-Symbol would change your `INBOX').  The first (optional) Emacs Lisp
expression gives you a better error message when you try to turn on
X-Symbol Mode in VM Mode.  The second line makes sure that VM always
uses VM Presentation Mode to display the articles.

How to Send a Bug/Problem Report
================================

   Bug fixes, bug/problem reports, improvements, and suggestions are
strongly appreciated.  So are corrections to this manual (better
explanations, correcting my English, ...).  Especially useful would be
some feedback by people using default fonts with a charset
registry-encoding other than `iso8859-1' (Western encoding).

   Please read this section carefully, even if you generally know how to
send a bug report (*note Bugs: (xemacs)Bugs.).  This might look tedious
to you, but it actually saves a lot of time (your time, too).

   For each bug/problem report or question you want to send to the
maintainer, please use the following sequence:

  1. Make sure that you use the *newest version* of X-Symbol.  You are
     reading Edition 4.5 (XEmacs) of the manual for X-Symbol 4.5.

  2. Read the manual, especially *Note Checking Installation::, *Note
     Problems:: and *Note FAQ::.  The four indexes (*note Indexes::.)
     might also lead you to an answer to your question.

  3. Use `M-x x-symbol-package-bug' (also to be found in X-Symbol's
     Command submenu) to write your report describing *one* bug or
     problem, i.e., use *different mails* for *unrelated problems*.
     Please do not "reuse" a mail thread with the maintainer, i.e., if
     you start a section with "Here is another problem", you do
     something wrong.

     If Emacs is not your mail tool, copy the Subject header line and
     the message body from Emacs' `*mail*' buffer to your mail tool.

     If `M-x x-symbol-package-bug' fails to work, you have a problem
     with your installation and your report should be about this
     problem.  In this case, use `x-symbol VERSION; SUMMARY' as Subject
     header where VERSION is the version of X-Symbol and SUMMARY is a
     brief summary of your installation problem.

     (*Rationale*: This command automatically extracts some essential
     information without any work by you.  Don't waste your time
     pondering whether you should really use this command to write your
     report.)

  4. Start your report with:

          In the manual, I checked the sections SECTION1, SECTION2,
          ..., but didn't find anything which helped me with the
          following problem:

     The sections SECTION1, SECTION2, etc are names (not numbers!) of
     the sections (not whole chapters!) in the manual where you would
     expect an answer to your question/problem/bug.

     If you didn't know which sections to inspect, please check the
     indexes.  If they are not helpful, send me words/terms which
     should be included in the indexes.

     (*Rationale*: This way, I get an idea where to improve the manual,
     especially by adding cross references.)

  5. If buffer `*Warnings*' does not exist in the buffer menu,
     everything is fine so far.  So is (for me as the author of package
     X-Symbol), if `X-Symbol' is not mentioned there.  Otherwise,
     include the contents of buffer `*Warnings*' into your bug report.

     Temporary Emacs (< v21.4) note: the warnings might be somewhere
     hidden in buffer `*Messages*'; please check that buffer.

  6. Put the parts of the code from `~/.emacs' and the system-wide files
     which causes the problem into a fresh file `MY-PROBLEM.el'.  The
     problem/error should be visible when invoking

          xemacs -no-site-file -q -l MY-PROBLEM.el

     In the minimal case, `MY-PROBLEM.EL' just contains the following
     line (*note Installing Lisp::.):

          (x-symbol-initialize)

     If the error has disappeared after you have included your complete
     `~/.xemacs/init.el' and `~/.emacs', the problem is likely caused
     by some code of your system-wide installation.  Include the code,
     which can be found using command `M-x find-library' with files
     `site-start' and `default' (everything is fine if these files do
     not exist).

     If you use `x-symbol-site.el' (its use is deprecated), copy its
     contents into `MY-PROBLEM.EL' and delete the corresponding `load'
     command.

     Attach the file `MY-PROBLEM.el' to your report.  *Please try to
     minimize the size of `MY-PROBLEM.el'*!  A standard technique is
     recursive halving: Delete the second half of `MY-PROBLEM.EL'.  If
     the problem disappears, delete the first half instead.  Do the
     same with the smaller file again, ....

     (*Rationale*: Most problems are a consequence of some specific
     customizations, but I don't have time to debug each user's init
     file.)

  7. If you have set variable `custom-file' in `MY-PROBLEM.el', attach
     the corresponding file to your report.

  8. If the error can only be reproduced in combination with another
     Emacs package, please send me:

        - If it is included in the standard Emacs/XEmacs distribution /
          if is an XEmacs package: the version you use if it is not
          that from the Emacs/XEmacs distribution (use `M-x
          find-library' to check whether you really use the version
          from the Emacs/XEmacs distribution).

        - If it is a non-standard (and non-obscure) package: the URL of
          the distribution and/or the source.

        - Otherwise: include its code into `MY-PROBLEM.el' and delete
          the corresponding `load' or `require' command.  Then, reduce
          the size of `MY-PROBLEM.el' as described above.

  9. If the problem is not reproducible with an *arbitrary* (`.tex',
     `.html', ...) file, try to minimize the file such that the problem
     can be still reproducible, and include the file with its full file
     name into your bug report.

     (*Rationale*: Most problems are only reproducible with specific
     files.)

 10. Finally, include the exact key sequence which causes the problem
     into your bug report.  You should also tell me the name of the
     buffer in which the problem occurred and how you have created that
     buffer (e.g., by `C-x C-f FILE <RET>').

     At best, you start your Emacs, and then try to reproduce the
     problem as fast as possible (i.e., with a minimum number of
     key/mouse strokes).

     As soon as the problem appears, press `C-h l' and include the
     contents of buffer `*Help*' in your bug report.

     (*Rationale*: Most problems are only reproducible with point being
     at a specific position in the file, with specific key sequences,
     etc.)

 11. If you have problem with the display of images, please include the
     output of the shell commands `convert -h' and `convert -list
     Format' in your bug report.  If the first command fails, you have a
     problem with the program `convert', not X-Symbol.

 12. If necessary, include a screen-shot in your bug report.

 13. If you could not use `M-x x-symbol-package-bug', include the
     contents of buffer `*Help*' after the following actions:

        - Type `C-h v x-symbol-version <RET>'.

        - Type `C-h v emacs-version <RET>'.

        - Type `C-h v features <RET>'.


   If you have solved your problem during this sequence, but you think
your situation is worth to be mention in this manual (e.g., in *Note
Package Integration::), I would appreciate if you would send me a some
new text for this manual or a normal bug report together with your
solution.

Changes in X-Symbol 4.5
-----------------------

   Version 4.5 has been released on March 2003 as beta.

   * X-Symbol finally respects the Mule coding system of each
     individual buffer.

   * Bug fix: would mess up encoding of math-mode characters with token
     language `bib'.  Other conversion fixes for languages `bib' and
     `texi'.

   * Bug fix (workaround for bug in XEmacs): auto-save files would have
     length 0.

   * Bug fix (Emacs): package now works with package `crypt'/`crypt++'.

   * Token language `sgml': always encode characters to entity
     references by default (not possible with most Latin-N characters,
     where we still use character entities).  Include `hm--html-mode',
     `html-helper-mode', remove `sgml-mode' as typical major modes.

   * Token language `tex': support some symbols of package
     `stmaryrd.sty'.

   * Change the auto-style, formerly auto-mode, mechanism.

   * Image support when running on Emacs.

   * New input method Quail, a usual Mule input method.

   * Corrected Latin-5 definitions.  Support Latin-5 ("Turkish") on
     XEmacs running under Windows.

   * X-Symbol works with Emacs/XEmacs running under a character
     terminal.

   * Improments for external languages.  Super-/subscript matching of
     token languages has changed.

   * X-Symbol can use package `format' and does not require special
     fonts for super-/subscripts with Emacs-21.4+.  Still open whether
     this will be used....

   * Dropped support for XEmacs-20.3.

   * Various bug fixes and minor changes.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Changes 4.4,  Next: Changes 4.1,  Prev: Changes 4.5,  Up: News

Changes in X-Symbol 4.2, 4.3, 4.4
---------------------------------

   Version 4.4 has been released on June 2002 as beta.

   * Token language TeX has changed: no excessive use of braces
     anymore, no excessive normalization, and aware of environments
     `{tabbing}' and `{verbatim}', and macro `\verb'.  Reading and
     saving "old-encoded" files works without changes in the file (the
     buffer looks different), there is also a command to remove the
     unwanted braces around accented letters.

   * New token language "BibTeX Macro" (`bib', similar to old `tex'),
     used for BibTeX files.

   * Nuked executables, the Lisp conversion for all languages is now 2-5
     times faster.

   * Latin-9 support.  Latin-9 font included in distribution.

   * Works with XEmacs-21.4+ on Windows.  Of course, it just supports a
     limited number of characters and no super- and subscripts there
     due to missing fonts.

   * More likely to save 8bit characters in the file by default: also
     look for 8bit characters in the file when visiting the file, also
     inspect master file (`TeX-master') with token language `tex'.

   * New buffer-local variable `x-symbol-unique': when non-`nil',
     decodes much less tokens to avoid near to all normalizations, used
     for TeX's style files (but X-Symbol is not automatically turned
     on).  Dropped token language `utex'.

   * Menu changes, new commands: submenu "Conversion", menu items "Copy
     Encoded", "Paste Decoded" and others.

   * Special coding for `preview-latex'.  Using X-Symbol now only gives
     a 10% overhead of `preview's parsing time.

   * X-Symbol now works with WhizzyTeX.

   * The interface for defining a token language has changed, it is
     also much more general, useful for ProofGeneral.

   * Changed final bytes of ISO 2022 escape sequence for X-Symbol
     charsets since Emacs reserves the characters `0-9' for itself.
     Does XEmacs has any policy here (it also uses `?')?

   * Dropped workaround for minor bug in XEmacs-20.X.

   * Various bug fixes and minor changes.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Changes 4.1,  Next: Changes 3.4,  Prev: Changes 4.4,  Up: News

Changes in X-Symbol 4.1
-----------------------

   Version 4.1 has been released on Mar 2002 as beta.

   * X-Symbol works with Emacs-21.1 or higher.  Porting is not
     complete, yet.

   * New token language "TeXinfo command" (`texi').

   * Slightly different definition of "valid character".

   * Remove the "local if set" and "default: ..." submenu stuff.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Changes 3.4,  Next: Changes 3.3,  Prev: Changes 4.1,  Up: News

Changes in X-Symbol 3.4
-----------------------

   Version 3.4 has been released on Mar 2002.

   * Moved to SourceForge.net.  Added files for nicer HTML output of
     manual.

   * Would sometimes perform strange conversions when
     `global-flyspell-mode' is enabled.

   * Bug fixes: command `M-x write-region' would always save the whole
     buffer if X-Symbol is enabled for that buffer, writing a remote
     file via ange-ftp would not work (was OK with efs).

   * Automatically deduce default coding via `locale -ck LC_CTYPE'.

   * Issue warning when running on XEmacs-21.0 to XEmacs-21.1.8.  Update
     manual: XEmacs user package directory is `~/.xemacs/packages'.

   * Directories ending with `//' in image search paths are recursive.

   * New characters used for token languages "TeX macro" and "Isabelle
     symbol".

   * Make sure to convert just the first part of a multi-part image.

   * Source distribution includes files for building an RPM package, all
     files also compile without Mule support.

   * Minor changes.  Manual changes.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Changes 3.3,  Next: Changes 3.2,  Prev: Changes 3.4,  Up: News

Changes in X-Symbol 3.3
-----------------------

   Version 3.3 has been released on Jan 1999.

   * Package X-Symbol is really a proper XEmacs package: no need to
     create fonts and to set the font path.  With XEmacs/no-Mule, I
     still recommend to create the executables (type `M-x
     x-symbol-exec-create').

   * New functions used for interaction with Emacs package `comint'.
     This is necessary for new token language "Isabelle symbol", to be
     distributed with Emacs package
     ProofGeneral (http://www.proofgeneral.org/).

   * New characters used for token languages "TeX macro" and "Isabelle
     symbol".

   * Minor changes.  Manual changes.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Changes 3.2,  Next: Changes 3.1,  Prev: Changes 3.3,  Up: News

Changes in X-Symbol 3.2
-----------------------

   Version 3.2 has been released on Dec 1998.

   * Package X-Symbol is a proper XEmacs package.  The installation
     process is much easier (using the binary package).  It has
     changed, though!  The use of file `x-symbol-site.el' is deprecated.

   * Reverting the buffer and using `vc' commands do not encode
     characters when not using `crypt'.  (This did not work always.)

   * Workaround for bug (segfault) in XEmacs-21/Mule betas.

   * Command `x-symbol-package-bug' is less restrictive.  Please use
     this command to contact the maintainer.

   * Bug fixes.  Minor changes.  Manual changes.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Changes 3.1,  Next: Changes 3.0,  Prev: Changes 3.2,  Up: News

Changes in X-Symbol 3.1
-----------------------

   Version 3.1 has been released on Oct 1998.

   * TeX macro `\mu' is represented by a character in the Adobe Symbol
     font, not in a Latin-{1,3,5} font anymore.

   * Support for most SGML entities in HTML-4.0 specification.

   * Additional characters for `\therefore'/`&there4;', `&oline;' and
     `&euro;'.

   * Package X-Symbol has been customized.

   * The documentation has been completed (as TeXinfo file).

   * Handle special URL prefixes `file:', `http:' for images.

   * Bug fixes, configuration changes.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Changes 3.0,  Next: Changes Old,  Prev: Changes 3.1,  Up: News

Changes in X-Symbol 3.0
-----------------------

   Version 3.0 has been released on Sep 1998 as beta.

   * Package X-Symbol now works on XEmacs with and without Mule support.
     Dropped support for XEmacs 19.13 to 19.16/20.2.

   * Full support of token language `sgml' (executables, subscripts,
     images).

   * X-Symbol is a proper minor mode.

   * Easier (automatic) 8bit character control (e.g., for `\times'
     `\pm',...).  By default, the encoding when saving only writes 8bit
     characters, if `\usepackage[latinN]{inputenc}' with N=1,2,3,5 was
     found in the first 10000 characters of the file (including
     commentary).

   * Package X-Symbol can be easily extended with new token languages
     and fonts due to its modular design.  It consistently handles
     situations where an entry for an additional character defines the
     same preferred key binding (and context) as for a previously
     defined character

   * Key bindings have completely changed.  They are now consistent
     with the contexts of input method Context (which have changed a
     bit).

   * The keys `@' and `!' are not used anymore as Modify- and
     Rotate-Key.  The Rotate key (instead of the Modify-Key) is used to
     "Greek"ify the previous Ascii char.

   * Input method Aggressive Context is now called input method
     Electric and is much more restrictive (using package `texmathp'
     with language "TeX macro").

   * Easier installation despite many additional features.

   * Supports more characters.

   * Nicer grid, info in echo area.

   * Better cooperation with packages: `vc' (check-out does not convert
     characters), `reftex' (no strange characters `\237', help with
     label creation), `auctex', `ispell', `font-latex' (no annoyances
     with `\exists').

   * Safer use of executables.

   * The code has completely changed.  You have to redo your
     installation.

Wishlist: Additional Token Languages
------------------------------------

   Making a contribution here would require just a basic knowledge of
Emacs and X-Symbol.  In fact, I would do the non-trivial part of the
Emacs Lisp part (*note Extending X-Symbol::.) for general-interest
token languages (e.g., AmsTeX).

   It is likely that this would require additional fonts: available
fonts (e.g., IPA font), hand-crafted, or generated (*note Wishlist
Fonts::.).


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Wishlist Fonts,  Next: Wishlist Emacs,  Prev: Wishlist Languages,  Up: Wishlist

Wishlist: Generated Fonts
-------------------------

   One direction of font generation would be from `.bdf' or `.pcf' font
files to Windows fonts to get rid of the limited support for XEmacs on
Windows (*note Requirements::.).  If you have successfully converted
X-Symbol's fonts from the Unix format to the Windows format (via
`bdftofon' or whatever) or if you have free and real Latin-N fonts for
Windows, please *let me know*!  I would also appreciate if you would
actively try to get those missing Windows fonts.

   Solofo Ramangalahy suggests to automatically generate the `.bdf'
fonts from other sources.  This would have various advantages:

   * We could easily create different sizes for our symbol font.

   * It would be quite simple to create a `.bdf' font for AmsTeX
     macros, calligraphical letters etc, which would be displayed as
     X-Symbol characters by package X-Symbol.

   * We could easily create different sizes for our symbol font.

   Solofo has worked on Postscript fonts.  Although the results are good
for big sizes, this cannot replace bdf fonts for "small" sizes like 14.
Besides, the X font server is not very good for postscript fonts
(compared with ATM where you have anti-aliasing for example).  Now that
XEmacs run under Windows, it may be that the result is better under
Windows than under Unix.  This has not been tested.

   An other possibility is to use true type fonts as true type font
servers can achieve better results with good hinted fonts.  This has
not been done yet.

   There are also some problems which are not optimally solved in the
current xsymb font either:

   * Different TeX macros (same appearance, different TeX class =
     different spacing) use the same MetaFont character, e.g., `\dagger'
     and `\dag'.  Therefore, we need different X11 characters for them.

   * Some Ascii characters have a special meaning in TeX.  The
     corresponding MetaFont character is therefore produced by a TeX
     macro, e.g., `{' by `\{'.  We need a X11 character which looks
     similar to the character but not exactly like it.

   We could ask the question whether we should really distinguish the
characters by appearance...we have the minibuffer info for the X-Symbol
character anyway....  Here are the options:

   - distinguished by size/underlining/miscellaneous (currently used),

   - distinguished by different spacing (my current favorite),

   - not distinguished

   Solofo Ramangalahy originally though of generating the `.bdf' fonts
out of TeX fonts (`.mf', `.pk') by `mftobdf' of SeeTeX, which can be
found at `CTAN/dviware/seetex/' among others distributions having this
tool.  He dropped this idea for the following reason:

     The created fonts need some correction by hand, since it's
     difficult to make good fonts at small size.  MF fonts were created
     to be printed at high resolutions (in the MetaFont book, cheapo is
     200 pixel per inch, resolution of screens are around 100 pixel per
     inch).  The parameters `blacker', `fillin' and `o_correction' are
     not sufficient for tuning the computer modern fonts at low
     resolutions (they will not do the job of hints of a postscript
     font).


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Wishlist Emacs,  Next: Wishlist LaTeX,  Prev: Wishlist Fonts,  Up: Wishlist

Wishlist: Changes in Emacs/XEmacs
---------------------------------

   Changes in Emacs and/or XEmacs would improve package X-Symbol, too:

   * In Emacs: a package system similar to XEmacs' one.  The
     installation would be easier.

   * The package `ispell' assumes the buffer contents to be the same as
     the file contents and does not provide any hook to fix this.  This
     should be fixed in `ispell' (it will be better in Emacs-21.4),
     *Note Miscellaneous Packages::.

   * Some versions control commands turn off `font-lock'.  This should
     be changed.

   * Provide a face property `raise': we wouldn't need extra fonts for
     super- and subscripts.  Emacs: it's already a display property,
     make it a face property, too (or make `font-lock' set properties
     other than faces).  XEmacs: no such property, yet.

   * You are sometimes unnecessarily asked (because X-Symbol will
     encode the corresponding characters anyway) for a safe coding
     system.  In Emacs (will be fixed in Emacs-21.4) for non-default
     Latin characters.  In XEmacs, for all non-default characters if
     you use package `latin-unity' (*note File IO Packages::.).

   * In Emacs, will be fixed in 21.4.  Using `isearch' and the input
     method Grid would not work.

   * In XEmacs, fixed in 21.X.  In `after-insert-file-functions', there
     should be a possibility to get to know the start position of the
     region which is inserted.  If `insert-file-contents' is called with
     argument `replace' being non-`nil', it is not always point.

   * In Emacs and XEmacs, will be fixed in Emacs-21.4.  Make
     possibility to change buffers in `write-region-annotate-functions'
     official, see *Note Alt Auto Conversion::, have a way to get the
     original buffer.

   * Since `font-lock' uses duplicable text properties in some cases, I
     need a function like `insert-buffer-substring-without-extents'.
     (Currently, I remove the extents afterwards, which looks slow for
     me.)

   * In XEmacs.  Run hooks in `post-command-hook' even if command exits
     with an error or quit (as it is in Emacs) or having some
     `post-error-or-quit-hook'.  *Note Nomule Problems::.

   * In XEmacs.  There are some bugs in package `custom'/`widget'
     (XEmacs-21.0-b59) which are visible during the customization of
     X-Symbol.


File: x-symbol.info,  Node: Wishlist LaTeX,  Next: Wishlist Various,  Prev: Wishlist Emacs,  Up: Wishlist

Wishlist: Changes in LaTeX
--------------------------

   Changes in LaTeX, especially `inputenc.sty', would improve package
X-Symbol, too:

   * To make the definition of the character U00B5 consistent with
     Unicode, `inputenc.sty' should define the character to stand not
     for the token `\mu' (U03BC is the right character), but for an
     extra token, e.g., something like `\textmicro'.  X-Symbol uses
     `\mathmicro' here in order to avoid changing `\mu' to the
     character U00B5 if you have chosen to store 8bit characters.

   * Use same encoding for both text and math, i.e. use `periodcentered'
     for both `\textperiodcentered' (the default) and `\cdot'.  At
     least provide text-and-math versions for characters where no
     alternative is more obvious than the other.  If that is not
     possible, always choose text mode except for `\lnot', `\pm',
     `\times' and `\division': use `\textonesuperior' for U00B9,
     \texttwosuperior for U00B2, and `\textthreesuperior' for U00B3.

   * The TeX macros `\textcent', `\textcurrency', `\textbrokenbar',
     `\textyen' are defined as not available with OT1 and T1 font
     encoding.  This should be changed.

Various Projects for X-Symbol
-----------------------------

   The following suggestions seem to be useful, though not essential:

   * It would be nice if we could print the buffer contents.
     Currently, you see strange characters instead X-Symbol's own
     characters.

     Printing non-standard fonts is only possible via the Emacs package
     `ps-print'.  A newer version of `ps-print' might be probably
     already capable of doing it.  Thus, you are encouraged to help the
     XEmacs team updating this package.

Rejected Suggestions for X-Symbol
---------------------------------

   The following suggestions seem to be not useful enough to be worth
the additional effort and increased package size.  I might be convinced
otherwise by patches (i.e., code, not text), though:

   * It would be nice if X-Symbol would replace the token with the last
     character of the token if this is possible (*note Input Method
     Token::.), not just with the next character.  Well, during typing,
     this is not really annoying and after a while, you will use input
     method Token only for very short tokens.

Open Questions
==============

   This section lists some minor open questions.

   * Loading file `x-symbol.el' will initialize package X-Symbol (via
     function `x-symbol-initialize'), since all functions will need the
     initialization.  In my opinion, this is no problem, since all
     customization options are defined an other files which do not
     require file `x-symbol.el'.  Thus, customizing package X-Symbol
     will not initialize package X-Symbol.

     The alternative would be to call function `x-symbol-initialize' in
     every function which can be autoloaded.  This seems quite tedious
     to me.  Also, I do not see a reason not to call
     `x-symbol-initialize' top-level in file `x-symbol.el'.  If I am
     wrong here, please let me know (with an explanation).
     Batch-compilation might be an issue...

   * When is necessary to set `x-symbol-auto-conversion-method' to
     `slowest'?  Of course, it is only necessary when using `crypt'.
     Is the other necessary condition to use the computer pool of the
     University of Edinburgh?

Acknowledgments
===============

   Stefan Monnier did many of the changes necessary for porting
X-Symbol to Emacs-21.  Fortunately, he not only changed X-Symbol to use
a quite different API on Emacs for things like charsets and menus, he
also made the necessary changes in Emacs itself.  Before that, Sang-Min
Lee started porting X-Symbol to Emacs-20.4, which was important for
moving the status of the Emacs port of X-Symbol from "todo" to "in
work".

   David Kastrup demonstrated that the old way of encoding characters to
TeX macros generally inhibited ligatures and kerns, i.e., it was worse
than expected.  He also discussed the details of how to do the encoding
and decoding right.  Christophe Raffalli suggested to use a decode
method which can be used for a larger class of token languages.  He
also proved that it is faster.

   Package `math-mode' by Renaud Marlet and the extension of it by
Julian Bradfield gave the basic idea for the following features:
supporting TeX's math macros, input methods token, context/electric,
super-/subscript support.  The shell script `makesub' is a merge and
change of the scripts `makesupers' and `makesub' by Julian.

   The font `xsymb0', which is distributed with this package, is a
minor modification (appearance) of the Adobe symbol font, thanks to its
non-restrictive copyright.  You may use the Adobe font instead.  The
special images are from package `frame-icon'.

   The idea for Help during an X-Symbol key sequence is from package
`x-compose'.  The general idea for showing some info in the echo area
is from package `eldoc'.  The trick which stops `expand-abbrev' is from
package `mail-abbrevs'.  The idea for
`x-symbol-image-cache-directories' is from package `fast-lock'.  The
code for image command parsing is influenced by some code in package
`font-lock'.  The code around `x-symbol-image-delete-extents' is based
on some code in package `bib-cite'.
