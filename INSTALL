Instructions for installing Proof General
=========================================

This file describes what to do to run Proof General.
Please let us know if you have problems trying to install it.

Unpack this distribution somewhere.  It will create a top-level
directory containing Proof General, called Proof-General-<something>.
Put this line in your .emacs file:

    (load-file "<proofgeneral-home>/generic/proof-site.el")

Where <proofgeneral-home> is replaced by the full path name to
Proof-General-<something>.  If you prefer not to edit .emacs,
you can use the script in bin/proofgeneral to launch Emacs with 
Proof General loaded.

The command above will set the Emacs load path and add auto-loads for
the assistants below:

  .v	    Coq files
  .l	    LEGO files
  .thy      Isabelle files
  .ML       Isabelle files
  .phx	    PhoX files
  .sml	    HOL98 files
  .elf	    Twelf files
  .acl2	    ACL2 files

When you load a file with one of these extensions, the corresponding
Proof General mode will be entered.

In case of difficulty, please check the documentation in doc/, the
notes below, and the file BUGS.  If this doesn't help, then contact us
via the address below.

Detailed installation Notes for Proof General
=============================================


RPM package.
------------

If you have the RPM file, this is the line you should add to your
.emacs file:

  (load-file "/usr/share/emacs/ProofGeneral/generic/proof-site.el")



Running on Windows 95/98/NT
---------------------------

We recommend XEmacs compiled for Windows, see http://www.xemacs.org

Unpack the Proof General tar or zip file, and rename the folder to
"ProofGeneral" to remove the version number.  Put a line like this:

   (load-file "c:\\ProofGeneral\\generic\\proof-site.el")

into .emacs.  You should put .emacs in value of HOME if you set that,
or else in directory you installled XEmacs in, e.g.  
c:\Program Files\XEmacs\.emacs


Dependency on Other Emacs Packages
----------------------------------

Proof General relies on several other Emacs packages, which are
probably already supplied with your version of Emacs.  If not,
you will need to find them.  Note that XEmacs is now being unbundled,
so you may need to select packages (or package groups) specially.
These are the packages that you need to use Proof General:

 ESSENTIAL:
  * cl-macs
  * comint	
  * custom
  * font-lock

 OPTIONAL:
  * outline
  * func-menu
  * X Symbol	  [ XEmacs only; separate download ]



Byte Compilation.
-----------------

Compilation of the Emacs lisp files improves efficiency but can
sometimes cause compatibility problems.  It is not supported in this
release.  If you want to experiment nonetheless, you can compile Proof
General by typing 'make' in the directory where you installed it.
This will result in lots of warnings and error messages most of which
can be ignored. Check the Makefile sets EMACS to your Emacs
executable.


Site-wide Installation
----------------------

If you are installing Proof General site-wide, you can put the
components in the standard directories of the filesystem if you
prefer, providing the variables in proof-site.el are adjusted
accordingly.  Make sure that the generic and assistant-specific elisp
files are kept in subdirectories of proof-home so that the autoload
directory calculations are correct.

To save every user needing the line in their .emacs file, you can put
that into a site-wide file like default.el.  Read the Emacs manual for
details.


Removing support for unwanted provers
-------------------------------------

You cannot run more than one instance of Proof General at a time:
e.g. if you're using Coq, you won't be able to run LEGO scripts.

If there are some assistants supported that you never want to use, 
you can remove them from the variable `proof-assistants`  
to prevent Proof General autoloading for files with particular
extensions.  This may be useful if you want to use other modes for
those files, for example, you may want sml-mode for .ML files or
Verilog mode for .v files.

The easiest way to do this (and other customization of Proof General)
is via the Customize mechanism, see the menu:

  Options -> Customize -> Emacs -> External -> Proof General

or, after loading Proof General, in a proof script buffer

  Proof-General -> Customize

You may need extra customization depending on the proof assistant (for
example, the name of the proof assistant binary).  See the menu

  Proof-General -> Customize -> <Name of Assistant>

and the notes below for more details.

Notice that the customization mechanism is only available in
Emacs 20.x and XEmacs.



----------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes for Coq
=============

Check the values of coq-tags and coq-prog-name in coq.el to see that
they correspond to the paths for coqtop and the library on your system.

Install coqtags in a standard place or add <proof-home>/coq to your PATH.
NB: You may need to change the path to perl at the top of the file.

If you are running Coq, generate a TAGS file for the library by running
	coqtags `find . -name \*.v -print`
in the root directory of the library, $COQTOP/theories.  If you are
running LEGO, do the same using legotags in the appropriate directory.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes for LEGO
==============

Install legotags in a standard place or add <proofgeneral-home>/lego 
to your PATH.
NB: You may need to change the path to perl at the top of the file.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes for Isabelle and Isabelle/Isar
====================================

Check the value of isabelle-prog-name.

If you use the interface wrapper scripts isa/interface or
isar/interface, you may need to change the path to bash
on the first line.

The distribution includes a version of Isamode's theory file mode.
Use C-h m to check on the features available.
