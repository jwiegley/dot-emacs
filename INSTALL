Instructions for installing Proof General
=========================================

Proof General runs on a variety of platforms and with a variety of
Emacs versions; see notes below for particular hints.  Please send us
additional hints for alternative platforms/Emacsen not mentioned.

To install, unpack the distribution somewhere.  It will create a
top-level directory containing Proof General, called
Proof-General-<something>.  Put this line in your .emacs file:

    (load-file "<proofgeneral-home>/generic/proof-site.el")

Where <proofgeneral-home> is replaced by the full path name to
Proof-General-<something>.  If you prefer not to edit .emacs,
you can use the script in bin/proofgeneral to launch Emacs with 
Proof General loaded.

The command above will set the Emacs load path and add auto-loads for
proof assistants, for example, visiting a file ending in .v will start
Coq Proof General, and a file ending in .thy will start 
Isabelle/Isar Proof General.  See the manual for a full list of file
extensions and proof assistants, and the note below for how to disable
those you don't need.

In case of difficulty, please check the documentation in doc/, the
notes below, the README file for each prover, and the file BUGS.  

If none of these files help, then contact me via the address below.

Detailed installation Notes for Proof General
=============================================

Supported Emacs Versions.
-------------------------

This release has been tested with XEmacs 21.4.14 and GNU Emacs 21.3.1
(running on i386 Linux).  We recommend using these or later versions.  

If you're not sure of your version of Emacs, inspect the
variable `emacs-version' by doing:

  C-h C-v emacs-version RET

Other *recent* versions of either Emacs may also work, but please do
not send bug reports for any version of Emacs which is more than a
year older than the most recent stable release of that Emacs, unless
you are reasonably sure that the bug has something to do with Proof
General rather than Emacs.  Unfortunately, compatibility across
different Emacs versions is very difficult to maintain as APIs change
frequently and bugs come and go between Emacs releases.



RPM packages.
------------

The RPMs are intended to be compatible with the RPMs distributed with
Red Hat/Fedora.  Three packages are provided: ProofGeneral,
ProofGeneral-emacs-elc and ProofGeneral-xemacs-elc.  The two elc RPMs
contain compiled elisp for GNU Emacs and XEmacs respectively.

You should have a fully working ProofGeneral if you just install the
main package.  The byte compiled files will provide extra
performance on the respective Emacs versions.

The command "proofgeneral" will launch Emacs with Proof General
loaded.  If you install the byte compiled files, Proof General should
be automatically added to your Emacs startup configuration: you can
just launch an Emacs and edit a proof script file to get going.

If you want to add the uncompiled Proof General version to your
personal Emacs configuration, add this line:

  (load-file "/usr/share/emacs/ProofGeneral/generic/proof-site.el")

to your .emacs file.


Running on Windows
------------------

Note that Windows compatibility isn't tested by the maintainers.  If
you discover problems, please send a fix to the address above.

We recommend XEmacs compiled for Windows, see http://www.xemacs.org.
Some Isabelle users have reported better operation with cygwin XEmacs.

Unpack the Proof General tar or zip file, and rename the folder to
"ProofGeneral" to remove the version number.  Put a line like this:

   (load-file "c:\\ProofGeneral\\generic\\proof-site.el")

into .emacs.  You should put .emacs in value of HOME if you set that,
or else in directory you installled XEmacs in, e.g.  
c:\Program Files\XEmacs\.emacs


Running on Mac OS X
-------------------

Larry Paulson maintains a web page on running Isabelle on Mac OS X
which includes instructions for using Proof General in that
environment.  See here:

   http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/HVG/Isabelle/macosx.html

His brief summary is:
 
  1. Install X11 or OroborOSX.
  2. Install XEmacs, or install GNU Emacs and recompile Proof General.

If you use XEmacs bear in mind the note below (if you are using fink,
install xemacs-sumo-pkg).


Dependency on Other Emacs Packages
----------------------------------

Proof General relies on several other Emacs packages, which are
probably already supplied with your version of Emacs.  If not, you
will need to find them.  XEmacs is sometimes unbundled, so you may
need to select packages (or package groups) specially.  These are the
packages that you need to use Proof General:

 ESSENTIAL:
  * cl-macs
  * comint	
  * custom
  * font-lock

 OPTIONAL:
  * outline
  * func-menu or imenu

If in doubt and you have the option, select the aptly named XEmacs
"sumo" package.

The X Symbol package is now bundled with Proof General so you
do not need to download it separately.



Byte Compilation.
-----------------

Compilation of the Emacs lisp files improves efficiency but can
sometimes cause compatibility problems.  In particular, byte compiled
files are generally not compatible between XEmacs and GNU Emacs.

We distribute .elcs for XEmacs, so you will have to delete
them and (optionally) recompile for GNU Emacs.

Use 'make clean' to remove all .elc files.  
Use 'make compile' to recompile .elc files.

Check that the Makefile sets EMACS to your Emacs executable.


Site-wide Installation
----------------------

If you are installing Proof General site-wide, you can put the
components in the standard directories of the filesystem if you
prefer, providing the variables in proof-site.el are adjusted
accordingly.  Make sure that the generic and assistant-specific elisp
files are kept in subdirectories of `proof-home-directory' so that the
autoload directory calculations are correct.

To save every user needing the line in their .emacs file, you can put
that into a site-wide file like default.el, or using an automatically
loaded file stored under site-start.d, if your distribution provides
that.  

The provided Makefile will install everything in default locations:

	make install

Will copy elisp, compiled elisp, documentation, and the "proofgeneral"
shell script into perhaps sensible places.  Try with "-n" or examine
the Makefile carefully before use.

  

Removing support for unwanted provers
-------------------------------------

You cannot run more than one instance of Proof General at a time in
the same Emacs process: e.g. if you're using Coq, you won't be able to
run LEGO scripts.

If there are some assistants supported that you never want to use, you
can remove them from the variable `proof-assistants' to prevent Proof
General autoloading for files with particular extensions.  This may be
useful if you want to use other modes for those files, for example,
you may want sml-mode for .ML files or Verilog mode for .v files.

The easiest way to do this (and other customization of Proof General)
is via the Customize mechanism, see the menu:

  Options -> Customize -> Emacs -> External -> Proof General

or, after loading Proof General, in a proof script buffer

  Proof-General -> Customize

You may need extra customization depending on the proof assistant (for
example, the name of the proof assistant binary).  See the menu

  Proof-General -> Customize -> <Name of Assistant>

and the manual for more details.
