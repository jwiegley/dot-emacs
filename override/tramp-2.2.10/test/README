This directory contains files for running Tramp related tests.

tramp-tests.el
        This file is a test suite.  It requires at least Emacs 24.4.
        Interactively, you can run the test suite by "M-x
        tramp-test-all".  A simple call of "make" from a shell runs
        the test suite in batch mode.  The environment variable
        $REMOTE_TEMPORARY_FILE_DIRECTORY can be set in order to run
        the tests on another remote host, see
        `tramp-test-temporary-file-directory' for the default value.
        If $REMOTE_ALLOW_PASSWORD is set, passwords can be entered in
        batch mode.

tramp-time.el
        These are performance tests on Tramp.  Read the "Commentary"
        section for details.
