Generate a git commit summary line from the provided diff.

- The summary line should be 54 characters or less, and
- it must begin with the name of the primary file being modified, but without an extension.
- This should be followed by a colon and space (": ") then a summary of the change.
- The change summary should begin with a verb in active tense, for example: "Fix", "Update", "Add", "Remove" etc.
- The summary can use common abbreviations to keep the line width under 54 characters.
- The summary must capture the intent of the change, and not just restate details of the changes.

So if files "foo.el" and "foo-bar.el" are changed in a commit to add X, the commit message could read

foo: Add support for X

If the changes are across many files and appear to be unconnected or disparate, mention the important ones with commas while staying under 60 characters.  Example:

foo: Add X, fix Y, remove Z from W

Examples of good summary lines:

gptel-integrations: Fix tool-import logic
gptel-bedrock: Add Claude 3-7 Sonnet (#887)
README: Explain difference between GitHub models/copilot
gptel: Reduce Windows curl-file-size-threshold

For each file mentioned in the body of the changelog, examine the git diff relating to that file and add a bullet-list description of the changes being made to each file.
