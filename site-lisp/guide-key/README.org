** Overview
guide-key.el displays the available key bindings automatically and dynamically.
guide-key aims to be an alternative of [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/OneKey][one-key.el]].

Here are some features of this library.
- guide-key automatically pops up the keys following your favorite
  prefixes. Moreover, even if you change key bindings, guide-key follows the
  change dynamically.
- guide-key can highlight particular commands. This makes it easy to find a
  command you are looking for, and to learn its key binding.
- guide-key doesn't overwrite existing commands and key bindings, so there
  is no interference with =describe-key= and =describe-bindings=.
** Installation
I added guide-key to [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][MELPA]]. You can install guide-key with package.el:

[[img/guide-key-package-install.png]]

Because guide-key depends on [[https://github.com/m2ym/popwin-el][popwin.el]], popwin.el is also installed.

If you don't have package.el, please download [[https://github.com/m2ym/popwin-el][m2ym/popwin-el]] and
[[https://github.com/kai2nenobu/guide-key][kai2nenobu/guide-key]] directly, and then put them in your =load-path=.
** Basic usage
Just add your favorite prefix keys to =guide-key/guide-key-sequence= as
below.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'guide-key)
(setq guide-key/guide-key-sequence '("C-x r" "C-x 4"))
(guide-key-mode 1)  ; Enable guide-key-mode
#+END_SRC
When you press these prefix keys, key bindings are automatically
popped up after a short delay (1 second by default).  This is a
screenshot when you press "C-x r".

[[img/guide-key-example.png]]

If =guide-key/guide-key-sequence= is =t=, any prefixes will pop up bindings.

guide-key can highlight commands which match a specified regular expression.
Key bindings following "C-x r" are =rectangle= family, =register= family and
=bookmark= family.  If you want to highlight only =rectangle= family
commands, put this setting in your init.el.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq guide-key/highlight-command-regexp "rectangle")
#+END_SRC

[[img/guide-key-example2.png]]

This feature makes it easy to find commands and learn their key bindings.  If
you want to highlight all families, you can specify multiple regular
expressions and faces as below.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq guide-key/highlight-command-regexp
      '("rectangle"
        ("register" . font-lock-type-face)
        ("bookmark" . "hot pink")))
#+END_SRC

[[img/guide-key-multiple-highlight.png]]

If an element of =guide-key/highlight-command-regexp= is a cons cell, its car
means a regular expression to highlight, and its cdr means a face or a color
name put on command names.

Moreover, prefix commands are automatically highlighted.

Depending on your level of emacs experience, you may want a shorter or
longer delay between pressing a key and the appearance of the guide
buffer.  This can be controlled by setting =guide-key/idle-delay=:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq guide-key/idle-delay 0.1)
#+END_SRC
The guide buffer is displayed only when you pause between keystrokes
for longer than this delay, so it will keep out of your way when you
are typing key sequences that you already know well.

I've confirmed that guide-key works well in these environments.
- Emacs 24.4, Ubuntu 14.04 or Windows 8.1 64bit
- Emacs 24.2, Ubuntu 12.04 or Windows 7 64bit
- Emacs 23.3, Ubuntu 12.04 or Windows 7 64bit
- Emacs 22.3, Windows 7 64bit
- Emacs 24.3.1, OS X 10.9
If popwin works, I think guide-key will work as well. You can use
guide-key with Emacs working in terminal.
** Advanced Usage
*** Check key sequence recursively
It is annoying to add many prefixes to =guide-key/guide-key-sequence=.
=guide-key/recursive-key-sequence-flag= releases you from this problem.  If
=guide-key/recursive-key-sequence-flag= is non-nil, guide-key checks an input
key sequence recursively. That is, if "C-x 8 ^" is an input key sequence,
guide-key checks whether =guide-key/guide-key-sequence= includes "C-x 8" and
"C-x".

For example, if you configure as below,
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq guide-key/guide-key-sequence '("C-x"))
(setq guide-key/recursive-key-sequence-flag t)
#+END_SRC
the guide buffer is popped up when you input "C-x r", "C-x 8" and
any other prefixes following "C-x".
*** Add settings in a particular mode
You can add extra settings in a particular mode. Please use
=guide-key/add-local-guide-key-sequence=,
=guide-key/add-local-highlight-command-regexp= and the hook of
that mode.

This code is an example for org-mode.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun guide-key/my-hook-function-for-org-mode ()
  (guide-key/add-local-guide-key-sequence "C-c")
  (guide-key/add-local-guide-key-sequence "C-c C-x")
  (guide-key/add-local-highlight-command-regexp "org-"))
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'guide-key/my-hook-function-for-org-mode)
#+END_SRC
If you execute =org-set-property= by pressing "C-c C-x p" in org-mode buffer,
Emacs behaves as below.

[[img/guide-key-example-org-anime.gif]]

In respect of =guide-key/guide-key-sequence=, you can add mode specific key
sequences without =guide-key/add-local-guide-key-sequence=. For example,
configure as below.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq guide-key/guide-key-sequence
      '("C-x r" "C-x 4"
        (org-mode "C-c C-x")
        (outline-minor-mode "C-c @")))
#+END_SRC
In this case, if the current major mode is =org-mode=, guide key bindings
following "C-c C-x".  If =outline-minor-mode= is enabled, guide key bindings
following "C-c @".
*** Work with =key-chord=
guide-key can work with [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/KeyChord][key-chord.el]].  If you want to guide key bindings
following key chord, you need to execute
=guide-key/key-chord-hack-on=.  Then, add your favorite key chord to
=guide-key/guide-key-sequence= as below.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(key-chord-define global-map "@4" 'ctl-x-4-prefix)

(guide-key/key-chord-hack-on)
(setq guide-key/guide-key-sequence '("<key-chord> @ 4" "<key-chord> 4 @"))
#+END_SRC

If =guide-key/recursive-key-sequence-flag= is non-nil, more simple.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(guide-key/key-chord-hack-on)
(setq guide-key/recursive-key-sequence-flag t)
(setq guide-key/guide-key-sequence '("<key-chord>"))
#+END_SRC
In this case, key bindings are popped up when you type any of key chords.

This hack *may be dangerous* because it advices primitive functions;
=this-command-keys= and =this-command-keys-vector=.
*** Other functions and variables
Here are some functions and variables which control guide-key.
- =(guide-key-mode ARG)=: =guide-key-mode= is implemented as a minor mode.
     Executing "M-x =guide-key-mode=" toggles whether guide-key is enabled or not.
     Because =guide-key-mode= is a global minor mode, =guide-key-mode= is enabled
     in all buffers or disabled in all buffers.
- =guide-key/popup-window-position=: This variable controls where a guide-key
     buffer is popped up. A value of this variable is one of =right=, =bottom=,
     =left=, =top=. The default value is =right=.
- =guide-key/polling-time=: This variable controls a polling time. The
     default value is 0.1 (in seconds).
- =guide-key/idle-delay=: This variable controls the delay between
  starting a key sequence and popping up the guide buffer. The default
  value is 1.0 (in seconds), which means that guide-key will keep out
  of your way unless you hesitate in the middle of a key sequence .
  Set this to 0.0 to revert to the old default behavior.
- =guide-key/text-scale-amount=: This variable controls the size of text in
  guide buffer. The default value is 0 (it means default size in Emacs). If
  you want to enlarge text, set positive number. Otherwise, set negative
  number.
** Known issues
Here are some issues and drawbacks.
- Because guide-key tries to pop up all key bindings, a size of popup window
  tends to be big. If the popup window is bigger than the current frame,
  guide-key cannot pop up normally. I recommend you not to add a prefix which
  has many key bindings like "C-x".
- A popup window sometimes closes immediately. It tends to happen right after
  a window controlled by popwin.el closes. In that case, please retry after
  you type "C-g" a couple of times.
- one-key can display a short description instead of its command name.  This
  is an advantage to creating template manually. In contrast, because
  guide-key extracts key bindings dynamically, guide-key can display nothing
  except a command name.
** TODOs
- [ ] confine a length of command name
- [ ] confine the number of items to guide
- [ ] a feature to exclude or include guide by command name
- [X] enrichment of guide buffer
  - [ ] select more user-friendly colors
- [X] automatically guide all following keys
- [X] pop up guide buffer at top or bottom
- [X] prefix argument processing
- [X] define global minor mode
