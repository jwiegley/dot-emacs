Installs the TeX style files into a permanent location.
This must be in the TeX search path.  If FORCE-OVERWRITE is greater
than 1, files will get overwritten without query, if it is less
than 1 or nil, the operation will fail.  The default of 1 for interactive
use will query.

Similarly FORCE-SAVE can be used for saving
`preview-TeX-style-dir' to record the fact that the uninstalled
files are no longer needed in the search path.
