[[https://melpa.org/#/org-web-tools][file:https://melpa.org/packages/org-web-tools-badge.svg]] [[https://stable.melpa.org/#/org-web-tools][file:https://stable.melpa.org/packages/org-web-tools-badge.svg]]

This file contains library functions and commands useful for retrieving web page content and processing it into Org-mode content.

For example, you can copy a URL to the clipboard or kill-ring, then run a command that downloads the page, isolates the "readable" content with =eww-readable=, converts it to Org-mode content with Pandoc, and displays it in an Org-mode buffer.  Another command does all of that but inserts it as an Org entry instead of displaying it in a new buffer.

* Installation                                                   :noexport_1:

This package requires Emacs 25.1 or later.
