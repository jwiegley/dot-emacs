2 Sections
**********

All items in the Monky buffers are nested 'sections'. The visibility of
the current section can be toggled using `TAB' key. When a section is
hidden, only its first line is shown and all its children are
completely invisible.

3 Status
********

Running `M-x monky-status' while visiting any file in a repo displays
the status of the hg repo. The status buffer list down the missing
files, untracked files and changed files. By default the diff of the
files are invisible. Use `TAB' key to toggle the visibility.

   During a merge the buffer will show the list of merged files, and
files unmodified during the merge.

6 Staging and Committing
************************

_Changes_ section will list all the changes in the repo. Using monky
you can select a subset of your changes and commit it. Type `s' to
stage a file. Typing `S' will stage all files.

   _Staged Changes_ section will list all the staged changes in the
repo. Type `u' to unstage a file. Typing `U' will unstage all the
previously staged files.

   Once you staged all the necessary files type `c'. This will pop-up a
buffer for the commit message. Typing `C-c C-c' will commit all the
staged files.

   You can reset the current working directory by typing `X'.

   Hg doesn't have any staging area. So staging and unstaging won't make
any changes to your repo unless you commit.

7 Merged Files
**************

After a merge, this section will list the files merged. Typing `m' will
mark the file as resolved and `x' will mark the file as unresolved.
After a merge, Hg doesn't allows to commit a subset of changes. so
files can't be staged or unstaged. So committing after a merge will
commit all the merged and unmodified files during the merge.
