* org-cliplink

  [[http://i.imgur.com/oA0birm.gif]]

  A simple command that takes a URL from the clipboard and inserts an
  org-mode link with a title of a page found by the URL into the
  current buffer.

  This code was a part of my Emacs config almost a year. I decided to
  publish it as a separate package in case someone needs this feature
  too.

* Usage

  Bind ~org-cliplink~ function to something. For example, put this
  line in your init file:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-x p i") 'org-cliplink)
  #+END_SRC

  Then copy any http/https URL to the clipboard, switch to the Emacs
  window and hit ~C-x p i~.

* Requirements

  - Linux
  - Emacs version 24.4+
  - cURL 7.35.0+ (optional)

** Windows

   Windows is not officially supported until [[https://github.com/rexim/org-cliplink/issues/35][#35]] is resolved.

   - GnuTLS — if you use Emacs installation from the official GNU FTP
     server — ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/ — you may simply
     download the latest version of GnuTLS from
     ftp://ftp.gnutls.org/gcrypt/gnutls/w32/ and copy the content of
     the downloaded archive to the emacs installation folder.

* Bugs

  https://github.com/rexim/org-cliplink/labels/bug

* Development

  1. open ~org-cliplink.el~ in Emacs;
  2. change something;
  3. ~M-x eval-buffer RET~;
  4. manual testing;
  5. go to 3 until it's done;

** Automated testing

   For automated testing you need to install [[http://cask.readthedocs.org/en/latest/][Cask]] first.

   To run unit tests:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     $ cask # only once to download development dependencies
     $ cask exec ert-runner
   #+END_SRC

   To run integration and unit tests together:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     $ ./run-travis-ci.sh
   #+END_SRC

   This exact script is run on every push to [[https://github.com/rexim/org-cliplink][org-cliplink GitHub repo]]
   on [[https://travis-ci.org/rexim/org-cliplink/][Travis CI]] (that's why it's called ~run-travis-ci.sh~). This
   script starts up a testing web-server, executes integrations tests
   defined in ~*-integration-tests.el~ files and executes unit tests
   after that.

   You can start the testing web-server standalone:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     $ ./run-testing-server.py
   #+END_SRC

   It requires Python 2.7.6+. It will serve ~test-data/site~ folder on
   different ports with different features (like HTTPS, Gziped
   content, Basic Auth, etc.).

   To stop the server just ~^C~ it.

   The automated testing stuff was tested only under Linux so far.

** Contribution

   This command doesn't handle some cases (like different encodings) but
   I do my best to improve it. If you find this code useful and want to
   make a contribution I'm waiting for your pull requests. :)
   
   Thanks.
