* Code

These come in handy while coding.

** Profiling

Why aren't macros like these in some default package?  Sure beats having to type ~(mapcar (lambda (it) (...it...)) list)~ over and over.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (defmacro it (&rest body)
    `(lambda (it)
       ,@body))
  (defmacro mapit (seq &rest body)
    `(mapcar (lambda (it)
               ,@body)
             ,seq))
#+END_SRC

This makes it easy to profile code:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (defmacro profile-rifle (times &rest body)
    `(let (output)
       (dolist (p '("helm-" "org-" "string-" "s-" "buffer-" "append" "delq" "map" "list" "car" "save-" "outline-" "delete-dups" "sort" "line-" "nth" "concat" "char-to-string" "rx-" "goto-" "when" "search-" "re-"))
         (elp-instrument-package p))
       (dotimes (x ,times)
         ,@body)
       (elp-results)
       (elp-restore-all)
       (point-min)
       (forward-line 20)
       (delete-region (point) (point-max))
       (setq output (buffer-substring-no-properties (point-min) (point-max)))
       (kill-buffer)
       (delete-window)
       output))

*** Slow code that splits on word boundaries

This code splits on word boundaries, but it's very slow.  Profiling it
showed the vast majority of the time was in =string-match=.  I'm
guessing the regexp is too complicated or unoptimized.

  ;; Reduce matching lines to matched word with context
  (setq matched-words-with-context

*** Faster version that cuts off mid-word

This version is much, much faster, but instead of matching on word
boundaries, it just matches so-many characters before and after the
token.  It's not quite as nice, but the speedup is worth it, and it
seems good enough.

This is the version currently in-use.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq matched-words-with-context
                    (cl-loop for line in (map 'list 'car matching-lines-in-node)
                             append (cl-loop for token in input
                                             for re = (rx-to-string '(and (repeat 0 25 not-newline)
                                                                          (eval token)
                                                                          (repeat 0 25 not-newline)))
                                             for m = (string-match re line end)

                                             for end = (match-end 1)
                                             when m

[2016-04-01 Fri 19:03] Somehow I broke it.  Now to fix it...

I don't understand why this loop isn't working like I want it to:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (cl-loop with end
           for line in (mapcar 'car matching-lines-in-node)
           for token in input
           for re = (rx-to-string `(and (repeat 0 ,helm-org-rifle-context-characters not-newline)
                                        (eval token)
                                        (repeat 0 ,helm-org-rifle-context-characters not-newline)))
           for match = (string-match re line end)
           for end = (match-end 0)
           when match
           collect (match-string-no-properties 0 line))
#+END_SRC

From what I can tell from the manual, it should do what I want.  Let's try this:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (cl-loop for line in '("1" "2" "3")
           for word in '("a" "b" "c")
           collect (list (format "Line:%s Word:%s" line word)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| Line:1 Word:a |
| Line:2 Word:b |
| Line:3 Word:c |

Well that does /not/ behave like Python list-comps.  So let's try nested:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (cl-loop for line in '("1" "2" "3")
           collect (cl-loop for word in '("a" "b" "c")
                            collect (format "Line:%s Word:%s" line word)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| Line:1 Word:a | Line:1 Word:b | Line:1 Word:c |
| Line:2 Word:a | Line:2 Word:b | Line:2 Word:c |
| Line:3 Word:a | Line:3 Word:b | Line:3 Word:c |

There.  So this loop should work:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (cl-loop with end
           for line in (mapcar 'car matching-lines-in-node)
for end = nil
           collect (cl-loop for token in input
                            for re = (rx-to-string `(and (repeat 0 ,helm-org-rifle-context-characters not-newline)
                                                         (eval token)
                                                         (repeat 0 ,helm-org-rifle-context-characters not-newline)))
                            for match = (string-match re line end)
                            for end = (match-end 0)
                            when match
                            collect (match-string-no-properties 0 line)))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(helm-org-rifle-get-candidates-in-buffer (get-file-buffer "~/org/inbox.org") "emacs :org:")
#+END_SRC

Hm...not quite.  Well, this is the code from just before the commit that broke it:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq matched-words-with-context
        (cl-loop for line in (map 'list 'car matching-lines-in-node)
                 append (cl-loop with end
                                 for token in input
                                 for re = (rx-to-string `(and (repeat 0 ,helm-org-rifle-context-characters not-newline)
                                                              (eval token)
                                                              (repeat 0 ,helm-org-rifle-context-characters not-newline)))
                                 for match = (string-match re line end)
                                 if match
                                 do (setq end (match-end 0))
                                 and collect (match-string-no-properties 0 line)

Okay, that's bad.  But something is obviously wrong, because it's calling =rx-form= and =search-forward-regexp= way too many times.  Let's see...

The problem is that the =positive-re= is matching anywhere, not just at word boundaries, so it's matching way too many nodes.  Well, that is /a/ problem; I don't know if it explains the entire slowdown.

For example, this matches =overwhelming= because of the =helm= in the middle:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
"\\(\\(?:[ 	]+\\(:[[:alnum:]_@#%%:]+:\\)\\)?\\| \\)emacs\\(\\(?:[ 	]+\\(:[[:alnum:]_@#%%:]+:\\)\\)?\\| \\|$\\)\\|\\(\\(?:[ 	]+\\(:[[:alnum:]_@#%%:]+:\\)\\)?\\| \\)helm\\(\\(?:[ 	]+\\(:[[:alnum:]_@#%%:]+:\\)\\)?\\| \\|$\\)"
#+END_SRC

Okay, the problem now is that I changed =helm-org-rifle-tags-re= to fix tag matching, but that same regexp is used in =helm-org-rifle-prep-token=, and now that function is matching any token as a tag and giving the wrong result.

I do not understand /why/ it's doing that, because that regexp is only supposed to match /tags/...

Okay, the other regexp that I kept commented out appears to match actual tags, as in it's useful for testing whether a string /is/ a tag:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(org-re ":\\([[:alnum:]_@#%:]+\\):[ \t]*$")
#+END_SRC

While this one appears to match tags in a document, potentially in a list of tags:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(org-re "\\(?:[ \t]+\\(:[[:alnum:]_@#%%:]+:\\)\\)?")
#+END_SRC

Okay, I fixed it, I had an =if match= instead of a =while match= in the =matched-words-with-context= loop.

Now to profile and compare with the pre-fix-context version:

[2016-04-02 Sat 00:14] Well, that's definitely worse, although it's still probably fast enough, because the elp instrumentation makes it a lot slower.

I'm also noticing that when I eval the buffer of the old version, and then the new one, and back and forth, it's giving different results than when I start a new Emacs session before eval'ing each buffer.  The content-fixed version is still slower, but it's annoying that they are somehow interfering with each other...

Oh, I know what it probably is: =defvar= not changing already-defined vars.  Gah, I wish there were a "developer mode" that would automatically treat =defvar= as =setq=!  That might also be causing different results to be returned.

And on that note, notice that the old version is running =org-heading-components= 9350 times and the new one 9750 times (divided by 50 runs, of course).  That means the newer one is returning more results.  That's /probably/ a good thing--better than returning fewer results--but it's still an annoying discrepancy.

Well, anyway, it seems that the new version is working properly, even if it is a bit slower.  I can probably optimize it some from here by profiling it some more.  And it's probably still fast enough anyway.  I'm going to commit these test results and go from there.

[2016-04-02 Sat 00:24] I just noticed that the new version has =search-forward-regexp= while the old shows =re-search-forward=.  I guess I accidentally used one instead of the other.  And I didn't have =re-= in the =profile-rifle= macro, so it wasn't being instrumented.  But I can't even find out what the difference between those two functions is.  Their docstrings are identical, but =re-search-forward= says it's "an interactive built-in function in `C source code'" and =search-forward-regexp= says it's an "interactive built-in function".  If one were an alias for the other, wouldn't it say so, like other functions do?  And I just googled it, and I can't even find any discussions disambiguating them.

Well, I guess I will change all the =search-forward-regexp= to =re-search-forward= and profile it again, now with =re-= instrumented...

Well, that made it a bit slower... and =re-search-forward= is running 1915 times per run, which seems like a lot.  Well, just for fun, let's see if =search-forward-regexp= is any different...

Well, seems about the same.  Some other functions are calling =re-search-forward=.  I guess I'll stick to =re-search-forward= for consistency.

Let's see if I can optimize this regexp, because it's the one used for finding the next matching node:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(positive-re (mapconcat 'helm-org-rifle-prep-token input "\\|"))
#+END_SRC

Wait...I think I can't do that, because each token has to be handled separately in case it's a tag.  At least, that's the way I found that works.

I just realized something: because =re-= wasn't instrumented when I profiled the pre-context-fix code, that probably made the test runs a lot faster.  I should rerun that test now that I've instrumented =re-=:

Uh...that's a lot slower...even slower than the context-fixed version.  And it's running =re-search-forward= about 1/3rd fewer times, yet it's still slower.  That means the context-fixed version is faster...yet it doesn't /feel/ faster...  This is getting really confusing.

...Or not!  I ran it again, and this time it was back to 0.38 seconds per run, instead of the 0.88 that it showed.  So the old version /is/ faster.  Argh, I even restarted Emacs between runs, but the results are still not always consistent.

(Haha, if anyone reads this on GitHub, they're going to be confused, because GitHub doesn't display results blocks in their Org renderer.)

Maybe the problem is [[file:helm-org-rifle.el::thereis%20(s-matches?%20re%20target)))][here]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(s-matches? re target)
#+END_SRC

In the pre-context-fix version, I'm using:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(s-contains? token target t)
#+END_SRC

I think I changed to the regexp version because the =s-contains?= version was doing substring matching, which I don't want.  Let's switch it real quick just to see if that's the problem:

Eh, it's only about 20ms faster per run, although =s-contains?= is more than twice as fast as =s-matches?=.  But it's still such a short time that it doesn't make much difference.

This is probably where the =next-gen= branch would be easier to optimize.  Even if all the extra function calls took their toll, at least I could profile each one separately.  With this, I see all those =re-search-forward= calls listed, but it's hard to figure out why that's making it slower than the pre-context-fix version.

Okay, I think I see what the problem is, or almost:

Pre-context-fix: =re-search-forward 61250 3.4628969270 5.653...e-05=
Post-context-fix: =re-search-forward 78050 10.705968030 0.0001371680=

The time per call to this function in the old version is much shorter, so the problem must be the regexp complexity.  And that is a bit annoying, because I thought I was being careful to make it simpler, like by wrapping the whole regexp in the word-boundary matcher instead of each token in the =or= group.

It's almost surely this one: ~(re-search-forward positive-re node-end t)~, because the other two are the negation one (which isn't being called in this test), and the per-node matcher ~(re-search-forward positive-re nil t)~, which is only run once per partially-matching node, in the main loop, while the other one runs multiple times per partially-matching node.  They both use the same regexp though.  Maybe if I can optimize the regexp used in that one...

I'm not sure that I can, though, because IIRC I had to do it this way to avoid substring matching:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (positive-re (mapconcat 'helm-org-rifle-prep-token input "\\|"))
#+END_SRC

Maybe having each token wrapped with =helm-org-rifle-prep-token= is the problem, but I think if I change that, I'll get substring matching, which I don't want.  Also there's [[*Weird%20heading-only,%20second-word%20substring%20matching][this]]: while before I /thought/ I wasn't getting substring matching, it might be that I actually was, but only for tokens after the first.

Sigh.  I can see how having a testing framework for this would help a lot...

Well, I'm going to try a quick experiment: the faster version has this:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq matching-positions-in-node
        (or (cl-loop for token in all-tokens
                     do (goto-char node-beg)
                     while (re-search-forward (helm-org-rifle-prep-token token) node-end t)
                     when negations
                     when (cl-loop for negation in negations
                                   thereis (s-matches? negation
                                                       (buffer-substring-no-properties (line-beginning-position)
                                                                                       (line-end-position))))
                     return nil
                     collect (line-beginning-position) into result
                     do (end-of-line)
                     finally return (sort (delete-dups result) '<))
            ;; Negation found; skip node
            (throw 'negated (goto-char node-end))))
#+END_SRC

And the slower version has this:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (when (and negations
             (re-search-forward negations-re node-end t))
    (throw 'negated (goto-char node-end)))
  
  (setq matching-positions-in-node
        (cl-loop initially (goto-char node-beg)
                 while (re-search-forward positive-re node-end t)
                 collect (line-beginning-position) into result
                 do (end-of-line)
                 finally return (sort (delete-dups result) '<)))
#+END_SRC

It's hard for me to imagine how the first one is faster, even without negations, because it should be running more searches, about one for each token times the number of matching lines, rather than one for the number of matching lines.  And =helm-org-rifle-prep-token= is being called...well it should be a /lot/ of times, once per token per node, at least, so that /should/ be much slower! But maybe the more complex regexp is /that/ much slower, so that running more, simpler searches is faster.  Let's find out... one, ta-hoo-hoo, tha-ree...

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq matching-positions-in-node
        (cl-loop for token in input
                 do (goto-char node-beg)
                 while (re-search-forward (helm-org-rifle-prep-token token) node-end t)
                 collect (line-beginning-position) into result
                 do (end-of-line)
                 finally return (sort (delete-dups result) '<)))

Well, that's basically the same.  Even though =helm-org-rifle-prep-token= is being called 19,400 times now (whereas before it wasn't even on the chart), the overall run is about the same speed.  And =re-search-forward= is being called 110,600 times instead of 78,050 times, and that's adding two seconds to the overall time, yet the overall time is only 1 second slower, and each run is only 0.02 seconds slower.

I really don't know.  It's probably still acceptably fast, but I'm not happy that it's 240 ms slower per run than it was before.

Wait...is it the context matching that's slowing it down?  That would seem to make sense, but I don't see =string-match= or =match-string-no-properties= on the chart, which are called a lot in the context-getting part.  Again, this is where the =next-gen= branch would be easier to profile, because that part would be in a separate function, which would show up on the benchmark.

Okay, so let's try disabling the context-matching and see if that helps narrow it down.

Wow...nope.  I set the context matches to a hardcoded string, and it actually took longer.  That makes noooooo sense.  I guess the context matching isn't the problem.

Ok then, let's see if avoiding substring matches is really the problem.  Let's change that back so that it does match substrings and see if it's faster again:

Uh, before I do that... I see a discrepancy in the code:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq matching-positions-in-node
        (cl-loop initially (goto-char node-beg)
                 while (re-search-forward positive-re node-end t)
                 collect (line-beginning-position) into result
                 do (end-of-line)
                 finally return (sort (delete-dups result) '<)))

  ;;                ;; Get text of each matching line
  ;;                for string = (buffer-substring-no-properties (line-beginning-position)
  ;;                                                             (line-end-position))
  ;;                unless (org-at-heading-p) ; Leave headings out of list of matched lines
  ;;                ;; (DISPLAY . REAL) format for Helm
  ;;                collect `(,string . (,buffer ,pos))))
  (setq matching-positions-in-node
        (cl-loop for token in input
                 do (goto-char node-beg)
                 while (re-search-forward (helm-org-rifle-prep-token token) node-end t)
                 collect (line-beginning-position) into result
                 do (end-of-line)
                 finally return (sort (delete-dups result) '<)))
#+END_SRC 

Somehow I put two of these loops in while commenting out the =matching-lines-in-node= part.  So running that loop twice could explain the slowdown...but then how were any context lines being displayed at all?  Wow...how did I manage to do that...  Oh I think I see, when I was testing the other =matching-positions-in-node= loop, I commented out and replaced the wrong one.  So...let's fix that and profile again:

Okay, that is slightly faster, but this matches substrings, which I don't want.  So if I kept this, it would be a slight improvement over the current master in that it would fix the context matching while being a little bit slower.

I wonder if I could compromise and match substrings but only at the beginning of words (or after punctuation).  That could be useful anyway, because it would avoid the "did I use a plural" problem.  Let's see if I can try it...

Wait, if I do that, it might mess up the tags matching that took so long to fix.

I wonder if I should separate out the tags matching.  I already have it getting a list of tags in a separate string.  If I removed tags-matching tokens from the input and matched them separately, maybe it would let me use a simpler regexp for everything else and avoid the prep function.  I should probably make another branch to test that idea...sigh.  And I don't even know if that would improve performance.  I'd have to first separate out the tags matching, then verify that it works properly, and then simplify the main =positive-re= regexp, and then see if it is faster.

I think I'm going to stop here.  It seems to work properly right now: context-matching, tag-matching, avoids substring matches, and negation works.  And it seems fast enough, even if it is slower than before.  Maybe there is some combination of these changes that makes everything work at about the same speed as before, but I think trying to figure it out is too complicated with this big candidates-getting function.  I think it would be better to settle on this code that works correctly, and then go back to the =next-gen= branch and try to improve that, which is structured in a simpler way.

[2016-04-02 Sat 02:21] I decided to test in the MELPA sandbox before merging with master and pushing, and it's a good thing I did, because I discovered another weird bug: if the =show-tags= setting is off, the results are way off.  Probably a simpleish logic error in the code somewhere...but I think at this point I should just remove that setting.  As it is it's off by default, and I wonder how many people have gotten bad results because of it and decided that this package is no good.  I doubt anyone would want it off anyway, and it doesn't seem to hurt performance.  So let's just remove that so it's consistent...

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I looked at your code a bit and it looks quite good. I would try to enable lexical binding, I've noticed that you depend on dynamic lookup somewhere: instead pass the data as arguments, it's going to be much faster still (dynamic lookup can be awful slow)

** TODO Try inserting outline paths into separators/overlays in occur buffers

Using overlays should prevent Org itself from re-fontifying the paths.

** TODO [#C] Try org-map-entries

I don't know why I didn't realize this sooner, but =org-map-entries= could likely do much of the logic in =helm-org-rifle--get-candidates-in-buffer=.  I don't know for certain if it would be faster, but since it has optional caching, it might very well be.  And it makes it easy to get inherited tags, properties, etc, and to run on regions, subtrees, etc.  Might even completely handle tag matching for me.  Very powerful.  I should definitely try it, and if the performance is good enough, use it.

e.g. this code from =swiper/counsel/ivy=:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (org-map-entries
   (lambda ()
     (let* ((components (org-heading-components))
            (level (make-string
                    (if org-odd-levels-only
                        (nth 1 components)
                      (nth 0 components))
                    ?*))
            (todo      (nth 2 components))
            (priority  (nth 3 components))
            (text      (nth 4 components))
            (tags      (nth 5 components)))
       (list (mapconcat 'identity
                        (cl-remove-if 'null
                                      (list level todo
                                            (if priority (format "[#%c]" priority))
                                            text tags))
                        " ")

   nil
   'agenda)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC
(org-map-entries FUNC &optional MATCH SCOPE &rest SKIP)

Call FUNC at each headline selected by MATCH in SCOPE.

FUNC is a function or a lisp form.  The function will be called without
arguments, with the cursor positioned at the beginning of the headline.
The return values of all calls to the function will be collected and
returned as a list.

The call to FUNC will be wrapped into a save-excursion form, so FUNC
does not need to preserve point.  After evaluation, the cursor will be
moved to the end of the line (presumably of the headline of the
processed entry) and search continues from there.  Under some
circumstances, this may not produce the wanted results.  For example,
if you have removed (e.g. archived) the current (sub)tree it could
mean that the next entry will be skipped entirely.  In such cases, you
can specify the position from where search should continue by making
FUNC set the variable ‘org-map-continue-from’ to the desired buffer
position.

MATCH is a tags/property/todo match as it is used in the agenda tags view.
Only headlines that are matched by this query will be considered during
the iteration.  When MATCH is nil or t, all headlines will be
visited by the iteration.

SCOPE determines the scope of this command.  It can be any of:

nil     The current buffer, respecting the restriction if any
tree    The subtree started with the entry at point
region  The entries within the active region, if any
region-start-level
        The entries within the active region, but only those at
        the same level than the first one.
file    The current buffer, without restriction
file-with-archives
        The current buffer, and any archives associated with it
agenda  All agenda files
agenda-with-archives
        All agenda files with any archive files associated with them
(file1 file2 ...)
        If this is a list, all files in the list will be scanned

The remaining args are treated as settings for the skipping facilities of
the scanner.  The following items can be given here:

  archive    skip trees with the archive tag
  comment    skip trees with the COMMENT keyword
  function or Emacs Lisp form:
             will be used as value for ‘org-agenda-skip-function’, so
             whenever the function returns a position, FUNC will not be
             called for that entry and search will continue from the
             position returned

If your function needs to retrieve the tags including inherited tags
at the *current* entry, you can use the value of the variable
‘org-scanner-tags’ which will be much faster than getting the value
with ‘org-get-tags-at’.  If your function gets properties with
‘org-entry-properties’ at the *current* entry, bind ‘org-trust-scanner-tags’
to t around the call to ‘org-entry-properties’ to get the same speedup.
Note that if your function moves around to retrieve tags and properties at
a *different* entry, you cannot use these techniques.

** TODO [#B] Clean up persistent-action buffers

Thierry [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/issues/1747#issuecomment-295191205][showed]] me this example which I should be able to use:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
 (condition-case _err (helm :sources my-source <etc...>) (quit (delete-my-buffers-or-whatever)))
#+END_SRC

** MAYBE [#B] Use text properties instead of plists for timestamping
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       6defd9ba-53fe-4cb3-84a7-270085716bda
:END:

Similar to [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/commit/a794614c975a7decf7bcc58189b89e4d69475fff][this]] in Helm, text properties could be used to store timestamps for results in =helm-org-rifle-get-candidates-in-buffer=, and then it wouldn't be necessary to transform the candidates list into a plist and back.  Also, an arbitrary list of helper functions could be passed in and run on each node as the candidates list is built, making it easy to optionally record extra metadata.

** TODO [#B] Remove duplicate/overlapping results from occur buffer

Since entire entry contents are displayed by default in the =occur= commands, it should happen that some Org nodes may be displayed twice in the results buffer.  i.e. given a subtree like:

#+BEGIN_SRC txt
 * Emacs stuff
 ** Packages of interest
 *** ace-window
 *** Helm
 **** helm-info-emacs command
#+END_SRC

A search for =emacs= would first return the entire =Emacs stuff= subtree, including all 4 child nodes.  But it would also return the =helm-info-emacs command= node as a separate result since =emacs= appears in its heading.

Since the second result fits entirely inside the first result, the second should be discarded.

Alternatively, the whole command could be changed to only return each entry's own text, i.e. not child headings.  This seems like it might be more "correct," but it also seems like a matter of preference: in the example above, if the user searches for =emacs=, should the =ace-window= node be displayed?  It doesn't mention =emacs= directly, but it is relevant to Emacs since it's in that subtree.

This could probably be configurable without /too/ much added complexity...

** TODO Search files instead of buffers

e.g search agenda files, or files in a directory.  Maybe write a =with-unopened-file= macro (or something like that) to =find-buffer-visiting= or =find-file-noselect=, and close the buffer afterward if it wasn't already open.

** TODO Match tags separately

This would probably make it simpler and faster.  Rather than trying to match a tags token across the entire node, it could just be matched against the tags string.  Could probably do away with the complex and confusing tags regexp matching and simplify the prep-token function.

** TODO Case-sensitive if caps are present

It would be easy to disable case-folding if caps are present in the search string.

** TODO Substring matching

Does searching for "solution" match this subheading?

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(helm-org-rifle-get-candidates-in-buffer (get-file-buffer "test.org") "solution")
#+END_SRC

...No, it does not.  That will probably need to be an option, customizable and/or with a prefix arg.

incidentally, on the matter of searching for substrings... if i enter a single word to search for i get a results list. if i then start entering a second word helm filters the results for each character that i enter. so, i get substring searches for words after the first! (this is for headings...it gets more complicated if i do searches that return topic content.)

Hm, this is strange.  I'll have to check on it.

*** TODO Broken again

Now it's /doing/ substring matching again.  I specifically tested this earlier and it was working correctly, not matching substrings.  Now it's doing it again.  What.

** MAYBE Use grep to find matching lines

It might be faster, especially for unopened files, to use =grep -b= to get matching lines in a file, and then backtrack to find the node's heading, and then search the node.

** TODO Look at how [[https://github.com/jrblevin/deft][Deft]] searches files

It probably has some good techniques for doing it quickly.

** MAYBE flx sorting
[[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/issues/207][This swiper issue]] may have some good info about caching and such.  It might be too slow for rifle, or at least it might be too slow with lots of results.  Hmm...

It might be nice to only match against headings, but this is not as easy as it might seem.  This whole package is made to search both headings and content.

This Org function might make this fairly easy: =org-goto-local-search-headings=

Underway in the =heading-only-searches= branch.

When matching multiple tags in a string, the order of the tags matters, e.g. =:website:Emacs= does not match entries that are tagged =:Emacs:website:= or =:website:something:Emacs:=.  Not a big deal, but would be nice to fix it.  I suppose it could be useful to have this behavior, because the tags can always be specified separately, but it might be unexpected for it to work this way.
