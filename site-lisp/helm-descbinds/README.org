* Helm Descbinds
** What's this?
   Helm Descbinds provides an interface to emacs' =describe-bindings= making the
   currently active key bindings interactively searchable with helm.

   Additionally you have the following actions
   - Execute the command
   - Describe the command
   - Find the command

   And =C-z= will give you a persistent description of the current command.
