                    HaRe, the Haskell Refactorer
                a snapshot of our current prototype
                             01/08/2012
      http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/refactor-fp/hare.html

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This snapshot includes most dependencies (version A below), and
should build and work on Windows/Cygwin and Unix, with either gvim
6.2 or with emacs 21.4.

HaRe_07072010 (HaRe 0.6) is still a prototype, made available so
you can play with basic refactoring support for Haskell, and give us
feedback or bug reports (see below for changes since HaRe 0.5 and
known remaining issues). The major new feature in this 0.6 release -
apart from bug fixes - is a number of new refactorings.
WE DO NOT RECOMMEND TO USE THIS PROTOTYPE ON YOUR PRODUCTION SOURCES JUST YET!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------- what you need

0 basics:

  1. ghc-6.12.1
  2. hint-0.3.2.3 (available from cabal)
  3. unix/gnu tools (or cygwin tools, if on windows)
  4. vim or emacs (we've tested with gvim 6.2 and with emacs 21.4)
  5. If you intend on running the test suite, HUnit-1.0.

A [recommended] partial build

  (fewer tools needed, but tied to particular snapshot):

  1. fetch refactorer snapshot. this includes:
    - modified Programatica snapshot (includes happy output)
    - refactorer sources


--------------- one easy way to arrange these things

the following text assumes this directory structure
and unix/cygwin tools (adapt makefile if necessary):


  README.txt            <- you're reading this
  makefile
  editors               <- editor interface scripts for Vim/Emacs
  refactorer            <- refactorer

  StrategyLib-4.0-beta  <- Strafunski's library for strategic programming
  diffs                 <- modified files for tools
  tools                 <- programatica snapshot

You might want to check the paths in makefile,
refactorer/HuMakefile and refactorer/myghc--make for sanity wrt to
your system (you should not actually need Happy for A). They should
work without change on windows/cygwin (windows/mingw has also been
reported to work), and feedback from the first release suggests the
same for unixish systems, from Max OS X to Linux (please let us know
if not, or if you can add new platforms).

If on Suns, the call to ghc in refactorer/myghc--make needs a little
looking after: in principle, you could remove the SunOS*) case and
use the default case *). In practice, at least on Suns, you will
want to make sure that ghc uses the linker from binutils instead of
the Sun linker (order of magnitude difference in linking time..),
which is what setting GCC_EXEC_PREFIX before calling ghc does - just
put in the path to your local binutils installation.

***IMPORTANT*** for Mac OS users: please make sure that the .gvimrc
file contains the lines

          set noguipty
          set nocompatible


--------------- how to build

  1. run:
          runhaskell Setup.hs configure --prefix /path/to/hare
          (where /path/to/hare is a folder with read/write access)
          runhaskell Setup.hs build
          runhaskell Setup.hs install

          export PATH=/path/to/hare/bin:$PATH

--------------- how to use

  2. load the scripted interface into your favourite editor
     (you may or may not want to include this in your standard
      startup files for Haskell)

    - emacs:
      M-x load-file /path/to/hare/share/hare-0.6/haskell-refac.el
      M-x haskell-refac-mode
      (to switch off: M-x haskell-refac-mode)
      You will then need to customize HaRe to point to your installation
      so Programatica can find its chase files.
      In the refactoring menu, go to customize -> chasepaths.
      Replace HaskellLibraries with:  /path/to/hare/share/hare-0.6
      Choose Save.

    - gvim:
      :source editors/refactor.vim
      :RefacStart	(or select start from menu)
      :RefacStop	(or select stop from menu)
      You will then need to customize HaRe to point to your installation
      so Programatica can find its chase files.
      In the refactoring menu, go to customize -> chasepaths.
      Replace HaskellLibraries with:  /path/to/hare/share/hare-0.6
      Choose Save.

  3. this should give you a menu with refactoring commands,
     and a separate refactoring process.

  4. the Programatica frontend we use is project-based.  before
     doing any refactorings, you have to start a project (select
     "new" to start a project with only the current module in it,
     then select "chase" to add the Prelude modules). project
     settings are kept in a "hi" directory, created in the current
     directory (it is recommended to edit files from within the
     directory they reside in).

     ***IMPORTANT:*** Please re-create your projects once you have
     updated your HaRe to a new snapshot/release.

  5. for most refactorings, the editor interface will pass the
     current filename (should be the module name, as well), the
     refactoring command, and the current cursor position. For
     some refactorings, you'll also need to highlight an
     expression, or enter a new name. Here's the current list:

     Introduce Pattern Match    : place cursor over pattern variable

     Introduce Sub pattern      : place cursor over pattern variable

     Introduce Case Expression  : place cursor over pattern variable

                                  Must have equation in comment directly before
                                  definition of highlighted expression.

     Clone Analysis             : select from menu

                                  be prompted to add the new Constructor
                                  name, followed by any Type parameters as a
                                  complete string
     Split a tuple              : place cureso at start of top level definition that
                                  returns a tuple.

                                : highlight sub-expression to extract.

     Instantiate a general pattern
                                : select a function equation and enter
                                  the new instances for each pattern in the argument set.



     Extract an expression      : highlight an expression within a definition
     Convert data type to
     newtype                    : place cursor at start of data type

     add definition to merge    : place cursor at start of definition that is to be merged

     merge definitions          : use "add definition for merge" for each definition to be merged.
                                  then choose merge definitions from menu.

     fold function definition   : highlight function equation to fold against.

     fold constant definition   : highlight constant equation to foldl against.

                                : place cursor at start of field to remove.

     add field to data type
                                : place cursor over start of constructor.
                                  enter new field name.



     add debug information      : add trace calls to function by placing cursor at the

                                  be renamed, you'll be prompted for a
                                  new name

6. If the 'Customize' menu in Emacs does not work, you can do the customisation by:
   M-x customize-group / haskell-refac


--------------- known issues

- the editor interface still needs improvement, although
  all known bugs have been fixed (windows vim users: it is
  recommended to install vim in its standard location).

- there is no standard for associating comments with
  semantic entities. we use heuristics to decide when
  to move/remove comments together with definitions
  => these heuristics may not match everyone's
     commenting style

  outline:

    when (re-)moving a definition, we also (re-)move the last
    consecutive comments right before this definition (with at most one
    empty line between the comments and the definition); we also
    (re-)move the comment whose start location is in the same line as
    the definition's last line of code.

  Example:

    ....
    --Comment1

    --Comment2
    --Comment3

    fun1 x =  x+1  --Comment4
    --Comment5

    ...

  In this case, Comment2, Comment3 and Comment4 belong to function fun1.

- if you're routinely working in a mixed Windows/Unix setup, you'll
  notice that the file-format (encoding of line endings) of HaRe
  output depends on whether you're using a Windows or a Unix HaRe,
  not on whether the input is in Windows or Unix format.

- the Programatica frontend is currently limited to Haskell 98

- the Programatica frontend does not work with no-source files.

   + Adding an refactoring to the editor now only need to modify only file.

-- bugfixes
   + the 'Customize' menu did not work.

----------------changes from 16/09/2004

-- general

  + The API. An API for program analysis and tranformation. Together with Programatica and Strafunski,
    this API can be used for the implementation for elementary refactorings. The file that contains
    this API is RefacUtils.hs (the module name is RefacUtils). You can find the documentation for the
    API at HaRe_20012008/refactorer/doc.

  + The hidden token stream manipulation. The basic idea is to move the token stream manipulations
    from the implementation of individual refactorings to the API, so that a program transformation
    function from the API modifies not only the AST but also the token stream. This liberates the
    implementator of refactoring from caring about the token stream.

  + For those users who are interested in the implementation of refactorings, we have written and
    documented the implementation of two very simple refactorings: swapping the first two arguments
    of a function, and from it-then-else expression to case expression. You can find the implementation
    at HaRe_20012008/refactorer/RefacSwapArgs.hs, and HaRe_20012008/refactorer/RefacCase.hs.

  + We have a test suite to HaRe 0.3, and you can find it at HaRe_20012008/testing. There is a README file
    to explain how it works.


--------------- changes from  09/08/2004

-- bugfixes
   + demote directly recursive definition.
   + non-break space

---------------changes from 26/04/2004
- features
   + The refactor menu has been switched to hierarchical menus to reduce clutter.
   + In 'generalise a definition', 'replace all' has been switched on.

- refactoring
   - new refactorings:
    + 'from concrete to abstract data type': transforms a concrete data type defintion into an abstract one.
      This is a composite refactoring. It consists of five elementary refactorings:
      + 'Add field names': add field names to a data type declaration.
      + 'Add disriminators': add a discriminator for each data constructor defined in the identified data type.
      + 'Add constructors': add a constructor function for each data constructor defined in the identified data type.
      + 'Eliminate nested patterns': remove patterns nested in a pattern specified by the data constructor defined
                                     in the identified data type.
      + 'Eliminate patterns': remove those patterns specified by the data constructor defined in the identified data type.
      + 'Create an ADT module': create the ADT module interface.
    + 'eliminate intermidiate list' (this refactoring is still in an experimental stage)

   -bug fixes
    + After generalising a function with a type signature, the type signature is now commented out in the program source.
    + wrong layout when refactoring on operator functions.
    + wrong layout when refactoring on an expression ending with [] or ()

--------------- changes from 26/02/2004

- general

   - update to a new Programmatica version

- refactoring

   - new refactorings:
     + 'move def to another module' : move a definition from the current
                                      module to a user-specified module
     + 'clean imports'        : remove redundancies from the imports
     + 'make import implicit' : make the used entities from an
                                import explicit in the declaration
     + 'add to export'        : add an entity to the export list
     + 'remove from export'   : remove an entity from the export list

   - bugfixes:

    + qualified uses of a top-level identifier becomes
      unqualified after its definition has been demoted.

--------------- changes from 27/01/2004

- refactoring

  - features:
    + in 'introduce a new definition', 'replace all' has been
      switched on. The refactorer should be able to detect all
      identical expressions in the scope.
    + operators can now be renamed

  - bugfixes:
    + module names can differ from file names
    + avoid dangling parenthesis after unfoldDef
      (could trigger layout rule syntax errors)
    + do not reverse names of new variables introduced
      by unfoldDef (did you know that 0_x is legal?-)
    + do not trip over hard tabs
    + give an error message when trying to lifting a definition
      in a class/instance declaration to the top level.
    + only write client modules when they are really changed.
    + renaming data types should not rename data constructors as well
    + lifting defs should not add globally available ids as parameters
    + the reported layout bugs with lifitng and intro new defs have
      been fixed

  - known issues
    + hard tabs are not counted correctly yet
    + refactorings shouldn't introduce hard tabs!

- editor interfaces

  - features:
    + Emacs: thanks to help from JP Bernardy, we have now moved the
      emacs lisp script to a subset that both Emacs and XEmacs can
      work with; in the process, the gui has been cleaned up a bit
      and should now operate more like a normal minor mode..
    + Vim: don't try to open files modified by the refactorer,
      unless they are already associated with a buffer; show
      warning dialog instead (now in line with emacs version)

  - bugfixes:
    + Emacs: don't create separate refactoring processes per buffer

  - known issues
    + in Vim, it is still possible to start refactorings while
      there are modified buffers (fixed in Emacs a while ago)

--------------- changes from 01/10/2003

- general:

  - Programatica and HaRe have added workarounds for the Template
    Haskell syntax problems in ghc-6.0, so HaRe now builds with
    ghc-6.0.1 (ghc-6.2.1 has introduced yet another change, so does
    not work yet..)

  - upgraded to StrategyLib-4.0-beta

- refactoring:

  - Programatica frontend does now give source location information
    for all literals
    => refactorings should no longer have problems with String and
       Char literals

  - HaRe is now module-aware: all refactorings have been updated to
    try and take import/export relations into account.

  - following your requests, HaRe can now work with literate Haskell
    files. This relies on some guesswork, so expect to find some
    rough corners - please report your experience so we can try to
    fix problems. Might also interact oddly with our heuristics for
    attaching comments to definitions.

  - Automatic renaming has been disabled during liftOneLevel,
    liftToTopLevel, demote and generaliseDef. In the case that one
    of these refactorings will cause name clash/capture, the user
    will be prompted to do renaming first.

  - refactoring bugfixes:
    + introNewDef and generaliseDef now replace the marked expression
      itself, not the first occurrence of the marked expression
    + wrong layout during liftOneLevel
    + non-exhaustive case in RefacLocUtils.hs
    + missing parentheses during generaliseDef
    + a parameter can be now be removed from a direct recursive
      definition if it is not used in the definition.
    + when adding an parameter to a direct recursive definition, use
      the new formal parameter name, instead of the default actual argument
      name, as the actual argument inside this function.
    + the way to created a new name has been changed. For example add a
      new parameter 'y' to a definition 'f', the default argument name is
      f_y instead of 'f_y_1'.
    + erroneous caching of export list
    + multi-module undo
    ...

- editor interfaces:

  - Emacs now reloads files modified by the refactorer without
    prompting the user, and warns when a refactoring has changed
    files not currently opened.

  - editor interface bugfixes:
    Emacs:
    + the error-in-mini-buffer effects preventing file reloading
      in some Emacs configurations were finally traced and
      eliminated (the stopwatch issue also seems to be gone).
    + refac buffer now automatically scrolls to last line
    + refactorings are now blocked while there are unsaved buffers
