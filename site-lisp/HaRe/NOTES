Comparison of the hackage 0.6.0.2 version with this repo

1. editors directory removed

2. misc directory added

3. testing directory (still here :) )

4. Annotated the differences in ./refactorer

5. TODO: check StrategyLib and tools directories

-------------------------

Seems Language.Haskell.Interpreter will return an error if there are any warnings when loading a module.
Will modify tests to avoid warnings, for now, but must address in future.


Original tests (with good results) are here
  https://github.com/alanz/HaRe/tree/71f80d2a59058acd6088c98d9748999f90ab0195/testing

Original data structures are here

Requirements for interface to GHC data structures
-------------------------------------------------

1. Allow generic queries via SYB etc.

2. Allow generic transformations via SYB etc.

3. Maintain tokens with AST fragment. In particular
   a. If a fragment is duplicated, its tokens are duplicated.
   b. If a fragment is removed, its tokens are removed.
   c. If a partial refactor has been done, the token and AST manipulations remain sane
      e.g. The new AST SrcLocs can be tied up to the new token stream.

4. Do not obscure existing AST (Renamed or TypeChecked)
   i.e. allow matching on structures from AST.

5. Allow converting the structure back into a source file accurately
   reflecting only the required changes (via Token stream)

Options

  1. As is, but re-order everything. Problem comes with re-sequencing
     source locations in AST.

  2. As is, but put new interface on tokens only, to somehow tie them up to the AST.
     Q: How to mark changed AST elements, and keep them indexed into the tokens structure.
     Q: How to manage reconstructing the source file?

  3. Some kind of virtual zipper, with the hole element being an AST
     fragment and its associated tokens.
     Q: how would traversals work?
     Q: how would the structure be dumped at the end.

  4. Variation on 2: Some kind of annotated token stream, with markers
     on it to indicated tokens added to the original stream, removed
     from it, or replacing others. This could be something like a list
     of edit commands for an editor, and could be presented as such
     (perhaps).

Observations

  1. The tie-up between the AST and the tokens is via SrcLoc.Located

     The rich token stream is [(Located Token, String)]
     Each AST element is located.

  2. We currently have fetchOrigToks in the RefactGhc monad to get
     original tokens for an AST element

  3. At the moment, the Located part of the AST is not updated as
     re-arrangements are made. I suspect that the complexity of doing
     this will not be worth the result.

  4. The final output happens via the token stream.

  5. The only leeway with the RealSrcLoc is the Int pairs pertaining
     to the start and end line/col pairs. Perhaps use either -ve
     values, or add an offset. Max value of an int is guaranteed to be
     at least 2^29-1 or 536,870,911. Anything above 1M will do.

  6. The bind SrcLoc does not tie up directly with the token SrcLoc
     due to surrounding comments

  7. The surrounding indent can perhaps be managed within this
     structure.

  8. The GHC ParsedSource is in linear order, the RenamedSource is not


Further thoughts on Token/AST tie up
------------------------------------

Layout is the biggest problem, in terms of knock-on effect of layout changes.

This is a solved problem, in the pretty-print world.

So, try and represent the token tree as a representation of the layout
elements of the original AST.

To do this, must identify the critical layout points, REQUIRED by haskell.


Even further thoughts
---------------------

Consider using dual-tree as in diagrams. The theory is explained here
http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~byorgey/pub/monoid-pearl.pdf.

In this case the u annotation would be the token start and end.

The d actions would be
  Delete a span
  Add a span
