<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2> 

The purpose of keyboard macros in an editor is to expedite the
entering of key sequences that occur frequently and are lengthy or
inconvenient to type. GNU Emacs provides keyboard macros. Beginning
with Version 22, GNU Emacs contains the kmacro package, which provides
support for dealing with keyboard macros that have been defined and
named during the current Emacs session. Support for saving,
organizing, and reloading keyboard macros remains weak. The Emacros
package facilitates these tasks.

<p>

Emacros' way of saving macro definitions to files is based on the idea
that macro definitions should be separated by major modes to which
they pertain. The macros used when editing a TeX file, for example,
will not be needed when working on a C++ program. Moreover, within
each mode, there will be macros that should be available whenever
Emacs is in that mode, and others that are relevant for specific
projects only. Consequently, each mode should allow one global macro
file and several local ones in different directories as needed. This
arrangement makes it easy to keep track of existing macro definitions.

<p>

Emacros works with GNU Emacs Versions 21 and 22. Earlier versions are no
longer supported.

<h2><a name="installation">Download and Installation</a></h2> 

Click <a href="http://thbecker.net/free_software_utilities/emacs_lisp/emacros/emacros.tar.gz">here</a>
to download the Emacros package.

To install Emacros, place the file <code>emacros.elc</code> in some
directory DIR. Add the line

<pre>

(load-file "DIR/emacros.elc")

</pre>

to your Emacs initialization file, where you have replaced the string
"DIR" in the <code>load-file</code> call with the actual directory
where <code>emacros.elc</code> resides. "DIR" may of course be omitted
if <code>emacros.elc</code> is in a directory where Emacs looks for lisp
files. Be sure to load <code>emacros.elc</code> and <em>not</em>
<code>emacros.el</code>. It is customary but not necessary to put the
<code>.el</code> file in the same directory as the <code>.elc</code> file.

<p>

<a name="global_macro_dir">The</a> directory where your global macro files 
will be kept defaults to your home directory. You may wish to choose a 
different directory. In that case, you must also place the line

<pre>

(setq emacros-global-dir "DIR") 

</pre>

in your Emacs initialization file. DIR can be specified in unexpanded
form, e.g., as <code>"~/emacs"</code>, and it may be given with or
without trailing slash.

<h2><a name="manual"></a>Emacros Manual</h2> 

<h3><a name="naming_saving_executing">Naming, Saving, and Executing Keyboard Macros</a></h3> 

A keyboard macro really consists of two components: the (complicated)
key sequence which is to be entered, and the (short) command which
invokes the entering of the sequence. Here, we will refer to the
key sequence as the <em>macro</em>, and to the command as its <em>name</em>.

<p>

When you use Emacros, defining a keyboard macro is done as usual with
<code>C-x (</code> and <code>C-x )</code>, or with <code>F3</code>
and <code>F4</code>, whichever you prefer.

Emacros comes in when you name the macro: instead of giving the macro
a name with Emacs' <code>name-last-kbd-macro</code> or with kmacro's
<code>kmacro-name-last-macro</code>, you use
the Emacros function <code>emacros-name-last-kbd-macro-add</code>.

<h4><a name="emacros-name-last-kbd-macro-add">Function emacros-name-last-kbd-macro-add</a></h4> 

This function first prompts the user for a name to be given to the
most recently defined keyboard macro. The name must neither be the
empty string nor an integer, and it must only use letters, digits, and
the characters <code>_</code> and <code>-</code>. The name of an
existing Emacs Lisp function which is not a keyboard macro will not be
accepted as input.

<p>

Next, the function saves the macro definition to a file named
<code>MODE-mac.el</code>, where <code>MODE</code> is the name of the
current major mode. (See Section <a
href="#slashes_in_mode_names">Slashes in Mode Names</a> for a
qualification of this statement.) This file can be in the 
<a href="#global_macro_dir">directory for global macros<a>, 
in which case the macro will be available whenever
<code>MODE</code> is the major mode, or it can be in the current
directory, in which case the macro will be locally available whenever
<code>MODE</code> is the major mode and the file that is being visited
is from this directory. The function will ask you to choose between
<code>l</code> for local and <code>g</code> for global.

<p>

When <code>emacros-name-last-kbd-macro-add</code> is called with prefix
argument, as in

<pre>
C-u M-x emacros-name-last-kbd-macro-add RET
</pre>

then you will be prompted to explicitly enter the name of a file for saving
the macro.

<p>

If a macro with the same name already exists in the file that you are
saving to, you will be prompted for overwriting the existing definition.

<p>

It is possible to have several macro definitions with the same name, one in
the global macro file <code>MODE-mac.el</code> and the others in 
local files <code>MODE-mac.el</code>. When macros are being loaded, the 
last local defintion of a multiply defined macro name becomes the active
one. Functions that manipulate macro files, such as
<a href="#emacros-remove-macro">emacros-remove-macro</a>,
will always look in the local and global macro file to do their work.

<p>

Note that the function <code>emacros-name-last-kbd-macro-add</code>
does not add the newly defined macro to the keyboard macro ring that
is maintained by the kmacro package. See
Section <a href="#emacros_vs_kmacro">Emacros vs. Kmacro</a> below
for a more detailed explanation.

<p>

You may or may not want to bind the function
<code>emacros-name-last-kbd-macro-add</code> to a key. You could, for
example, bind it to <code>Ctrl-a</code> by placing the line

<pre>
(global-set-key "\C-ca" 'emacros-name-last-kbd-macro-add)
</pre>

in your Emacs initialization file.

<h4><a name="emacros-execute-named-macro">Function emacros-execute-named-macro</a></h4> 

Once a macro MACRO has a name MACRONAME, this name is in fact a
command which causes the macro to be inserted before the cursor:
typing 

<pre>
M-x MACRONAME RET
</pre>

inserts MACRO. This has the disadvantage that completion and history take
into account all command names rather than just macro names. The problem is
resolved by the function <code>emacros-execute-named-macro</code>.This
function should probably be bound to a key sequence such as
<code>Ctrl-c e</code>. The line

<pre>     
(global-set-key "\C-ce" 'emacros-execute-named-macro)
</pre>

in your Emacs initialization file does the job. Typing
<code>Ctrl-c e</code> is then similar to <code>M-x</code>, but for
macros only.

<h4><a name="emacros-auto-execute-named-macro">Function emacros-auto-execute-named-macro</a></h4> 

This function is provided as a further convenience for the impatient.
<code>emacros-auto-execute-named-macro</code> should definitely be
bound to a key if you intend to use it at all. For example,
<code>Ctrl-c x</code> would be a good choice. Typing <code>Ctrl-c x</code>
will then prompt for the name of a macro. The cursor will stay at its
position in the current buffer. As soon as the sequence
entered matches the name of a macro, the macro is inserted and
regular editing is resumed without the need to type a
<code>return</code>.

<p>

When entering the name of a macro for auto-execution, the
<code>return</code> key provides a rudimentary completion: the input
is completed as far as possible, and execution occurs automatically as
soon as a match has been found, even if it is "complete but not
unique" in the sense of Emacs.

<p>

It is clear that you can not in this way insert a macro whose name
contains the name of another macro as an initial substring. You may
want to simply avoid this situation; however, if it occurs, you can
always use <a
href=#emacros-execute-named-macro><code>emacros-execute-named-macro</code></a>
to insert such problem macros.

<h3><a name="loading">Loading Macro Definitions</a></h3> 

One of the most important features of Emacros is that macro
definitions are loaded automatically when a file is visited. There are
also ways to load and unload macros manually.

<h4><a name="automatic_loading">Automatic Macro Loading</a></h4> 

Everytime you read a file into Emacs with <code>Ctrl-x Ctrl-f</code>,
<code>Ctrl-x Ctrl-v</code>, or <code>Ctrl-x 4 f</code>, <a
name="emacros-load-macros">the function</a>

<pre>
emacros-load-macros 
</pre>

will be invoked automatically. It will load those macros that have
been saved to files named <code>MODE-mac.el</code> in the current
directory and in the directory for global macros. Here,
<code>MODE</code> is name of the major mode that Emacs has chosen for
the visited file. (See Section <a href="#slashes_in_mode_names">Slashes in Mode Names</a> 
for a qualification of this statement.) The function can also be used interactively; the
next section describes a situation where you may want to do this.

<h4><a name="manual_loading">Manually Loading and Unloading Macros</a></h4> 

If you have been editing a file and then visit another one with a
different mode and/or from a different directory, then the macros
pertaining to the new file will be loaded, and all others that were
loaded previously will remain active as well. If there are not too
many macros around, this is probably what you want. In the long run,
however, especially when you are one of those users that never leave
Emacs, you would end up with all macros being loaded, thus rendering
the separation by modes pointless. <a
name="emacros-refresh-macros">The function</a>

<pre>
emacros-refresh-macros 
</pre>

takes care of this problem. Typing 

<pre>
M-x emacros-refresh-macros RET 
</pre>

will unload all previously loaded macros and load the ones pertaining
to the current buffer, thus creating the same situation as if you had
just started Emacs and found the file that the current buffer is
visiting.

Another situation that necessitates similar action arises when you do
not work "mode-consciously." If, for example, you edit a file named
<code>test</code> and then turn it into a <code>.tex</code> file by typing

<pre>
C-x C-w test.tex RET
</pre>

then Emacros will not automatically load the macros for TeX mode. To
get things right, you must explicitly refresh your loaded macros:

<pre>
M-x emacros-refresh-macros RET 
</pre>

If you want to keep previously loaded macros active rather than
refreshing, then you want to replace
<code>emacros-refresh-macros</code> with
<a href="#emacros-load-macros"><code>emacros-load-macros</code></a> in the above.

Since the macro files <code>MODE-mac.el</code> contain ordinary Emacs
Lisp code, you may also make macros available by loading macro files
explicitly. This is done using the GNU Emacs function for loading Lisp
code, as in 

<pre>
M-x load-file RET
Load file: ~/thesis/TeX-mac.el RET
</pre>

This is also the way to load macros when you have used the function <a
href=#emacros-name-last-kbd-macro-add><code>emacros-name-last-kbd-macro-add</code></a>
with a prefix argument, thus choosing your own file for saving your
macros.

<h3><a name="manipulating">Manipulating Macro Files</a></h3> 

There are three functions that allow you to manipulate macro definitions
that have already been saved. You can rename macros, move them betweeen
local and global macro files, and remove them entirely.

<h4><a name="emacros-rename-macro">Function emacros-rename-macro</a></h4> 

This function assigns a new name to a previously named macro, making the
change effective in the current session and in the local or global macro
file pertaining to the current buffer, as appropriate.  The old name is
cleared of its meaning and may be used for a later macro. Typing

<pre>
M-x emacros-rename-macro RET
</pre>

will prompt for the old name that is to be changed and then for the
new name, subject to the same restrictions that apply when naming with
<a href="#emacros-name-last-kbd-macro-add"><code>emacros-name-last-kbd-macro-add</code></a>. 
Completion and history are available when entering the old name. If a
macro with the new name already exists in the file where the change
takes place, you will be prompted for overwriting the existing defintion.

<p>

<em>Note:</em> The function <code>emacros-rename-macro</code> can
access for renaming all those macros that pertain to the current
buffer. You cannot access just every macro that happens to have been
loaded during the current session. For example, if you have been
working on a TeX file, then change to a buffer visiting a
<code>.c</code> file, and then try to rename a macro named
<code>NAME</code> that is kept in <code>TeX-mac.el</code>, you will
get the message

<pre>
Macro named <code>NAME</code> not found in current file(s) C-mac.el: no action
taken.
</pre>

You must change back to the buffer visiting the TeX file before you
can access your macro for renaming.  All this applies to moving and
removing macros as well.

<h4><a name="emacros-move-macro">Function emacros-move-macro</a></h4> 

This function moves macro definitions between the local and global
macro file pertaining to the current buffer. Typing

<pre>
M-x emacros-move-macro RET
</pre>

will prompt for the name of a macro to be moved and for a choice
between "from local" and "from global" before performing the desired
task.

<h4><a name="emacros-remove-macro">Function emacros-remove-macro</a></h4> 

This function deletes macros from current macro files and disables
them in the current session. Typing

<pre>
M-x emacros-remove-macro RET
</pre>

will prompt for the name of the macro to be deleted. A macro that has
been deleted is irretrievably lost.  As with <a
href="#emacros-rename-macro"><code>emacros-rename-macro</code></a>, the
macro's name is made available for use with a different macro.

<h3><a name="help">Getting Help with Macros</a></h3> 

One way in which Emacros assists you with recalling macro names is by
offering completion and command line history whenever the name of a
macro is to be entered. Beyond that, there are two functions that
provide help with keyboard macros. You can list the names of all
currently defined macros, and you can obtain a list of the names of the
macros together with a textual representation of each macro's
definition. There is also the possibility to help yourself by
inspecting and editing the files where the macros are stored.

<h4><a name="emacros-show-macro-names">Function emacros-show-macro-names</a></h4>

The function <code>emacros-show-macro-names</code> displays a list of
the names of all currently defined macros in the Emacs
<code>*Help*</code> buffer, much like completion lists are displayed
in the <code>*Completion*</code> buffer. With prefix argument, as in

<pre>
C-u M-x emacros-show-macro-names RET
</pre>

the function displays the macro names in a single column rather than
in the two column format that Emacs uses for completion lists.

<h4><a name="emacros-show-macros">Function emacros-show-macros</a></h4>

The function <code>emacros-show-macros</code> displays a list of the
names of all currently defined macros together with a textual
representation of each macro's definition in the Emacs <code>*Help*</code>
buffer.

<p>

Those parts of a macro definition that are plain character insertions
are shown as strings in the textual representation. Function keys are
shown using Emacs' standard textual representation. Control and alt
keys are currently shown as "funny characters" in strings. For
example, if you were to define a macro named <code>bm</code> with
definition

<pre>
M-x buffer-menu RET
</pre>

then the output of the function <code>emacros-show-macros</code> would
display the following line for this macro:

<pre>
bm  "øbuffer-menu" &lt;return&gt;
</pre>

This is certainly less than perfect. It wouldn't be hard to fix, if
someone has the patience to do it.

<h3><a name="subtleties">Subtleties</a></h3> 

This chapter discusses a few subtleties about Emacros. Except perhaps
for the first section, these are things that the user should not really
have to worry about.

<h4><a name="getting_right_mode">Getting the Right Major Mode</a></h4>

There is a subtlety about Emacs' way of determining the major mode for
a visited file that needs attention when using Emacros. The problem
occurs when Emacs uses not only the file extension to determine the
mode, but actually looks into the file. An example for this is LaTeX
mode. The proper extension for LaTeX files is <code>.tex</code>. If
you visit a non-empty file with extension <code>tex</code>, and there
is nothing LaTeX-specific in it, then Emacs will put you in TeX
mode. If you then add the line

<pre>
\documentstyle[...]{...}
</pre>

to the top of the file and visit the file again later, you will find
yourself in LaTeX mode. The fact that the major mode is different
depending on what's in the file can of course cause a problem when
using Emacros. However, this can be fixed by choosing your mode
explicitly and loading macros manually: to be in LaTeX mode and have
your LaTex macros loaded regardless of what's in the file, you must
say

<pre>
M-x latex-mode RET
M-x emacros-refresh-macros RET
</pre>

or

<pre>
M-x latex-mode RET
M-x emacros-load-macros RET
</pre>

The first version will unload all currently defined macros and load the
ones for the LaTex buffer only. The second one loads the macros
for the LaTeX buffer on top of what may already be loaded.

<h4><a name="slashes_in_mode_names">Slashes in Mode Names</a></h4>

There are major modes for GNU Emacs whose name is not a constant
string.  The name of C++ mode, for example, is
"<code>C++</code>". However, when you turn on
<code>auto-newline</code> mode and <code>electric-mode</code>, the
mode name changes to "<code>C++/la</code>". The slash in the mode name
is of course a problem for Emacros, since it wants to use the mode
name as part of a file name. Fortunately, however, it is also
reasonable to ignore the qualifiations following the slash when it
comes to saving macros. Therefore, Emacros uses only the part of the
major mode name up to and not including the first forward slash when
it builds its macro file names.

<h4><a name="compatibility">Compatibility with Emacs' Macro Saving</a></h4>

Suppose you have been saving kbd-macros using the Emacs function
<code>insert-kbd-macro</code>, and you have loaded them by loading the
file in which they were saved. The Emacros functions for executing and
displaying macros will work for these macros.

<p>

To be able to rename, move, and remove your old macros by means of
Emacros functions, you must edit your macro files. First, replace
<code>fset</code> with <code>emacros-new-macro</code> in each macro
definition. Then move the macro definitions to the appropriate files
<code>MODE-mac.el</code>, placing each macro definition on a single
line.

<h4><a name="visiting_macro_files">Visiting Macro Files</a></h4>

The functions for saving, renaming, moving, or removing macro
definitions make changes to one or more of the files
<code>MODE-mac.el</code>. If you are visiting such a file when using
one of these functions and the respective buffer is modified, you will
be notified and asked if it is ok to continue and possibly save.
Answer <code>y</code> only if you are sure that the changes that you
have made are meaningful. If your answer is <code>n</code>, then no
action is taken at all.

<h4><a name="completion">Completing Macro Names</a></h4>

When a function requires the input of an existing macro name,
completion works just as it normally does in GNU Emacs. The only
exception is the function <a
href="#emacros-auto-execute-named-macro"><code>emacros-auto-execute-named-macro</code></a>.
Here, no completion lists are provided. The reason is that such a list
would necessarily be misleading: suppose you have three macros named
<code>abc</code>, <code>abd</code>, and <code>abcdefg</code>, and you
have enetered <code>ab</code>. Listing all three as completions would
be wrong because you cannot get to <code>abcdefg</code> with
auto-execution. On the other hand, listing just <code>abc</code> and
<code>abd</code> would be misleading as well because these are not the
only macro names that start with <code>ab</code>. Auto-execution is
really meant for frequently used macros whose names you just don't
have trouble with.

<h4><a name="emacros_vs_kmacro">Emacros vs. Kmacro</a></h4>
Beginnig with GNU Emacs Version 22, the kmacro package is part of the
GNU Emacs distribution. The kmacro package provides support for dealing
with macros that have been defined and named in the current Emacs session.
For example, it places all keyboard macros that have been defined and
named with the function <code>kmacro-name-last-macro</code> on the
keyboard macro ring for easy retrieval.

<p>

The Emacros package, by contrast, provides support for saving keyboard
macros to files and reloading them in future Emacs sessions. Keyboard
macros that have been named and saved with the Emacros function
<code>emacros-name-last-kbd-macro-add</code> are completely separate
from the kmacro world. In particular, they are not placed on kmacro's
macro ring. The main reason for this design decision is that in the
Emacros world, where keyboard macros are saved and reloaded, there will
often be a large number of macros. Holding them in a ring is not a very
good way to keep track of them. The functions <code>emacros-execute-named-macro</code>
and <code>emacros-auto-execute-named-macro</code> with their completion
features and the help functions <code>emacros-show-macros</code> and
<code>emacros-show-macro-names</code> are better suited for this purpose.
