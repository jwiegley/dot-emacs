#+PROPERTY: COOKIE_DATA todo recursive


* TODO Support line-continuation with commas [0/2]
  - [ ]  assignments
    x,y = long_value,
          other_long_value
  - [ ] `for ... do' operators

* TODO update site [0/2]
** TODO reuse section-aware template
** TODO add section for release downloading

* TODO [#C] Improve lua-prefix-key machinery [0/2]
  - [ ] add docs
  - [ ] improve setting prefix-key
    Currently, prefix-key is parsed from a macro string (which may
    contain more than one key) and all keys but the first one are
    silently removed. Maybe there's a better way to do it.

* TODO [#C] Redo syntax engine using semantic/wisent

* DONE Fix braces/parens that reduce indent by const offset
   this causes wrong behavior when indented block was
   anchored to first line, e.g.
   my_func( hello,
            world
         )

* DONE lua-mark-all-multiline-literals [5/5]
  - [X] process --[[ as multiline comment
  - [X] process ---[[ as single-line comment
    distinguish by syntax state of last dash before square bracket
  - [X] don't recognize [[ in comments or literals
  - [X] extend region backwards if BEGIN is inside multiline literal
  - [X] don't change buffer-modified-p state
