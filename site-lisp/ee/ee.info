1 Introduction
**************


Ee is the categorizing information manager for Emacs.
It works by collecting information from different
sources and converting information to a relational or
associative database.  It uses the fields of database
table records to build the category trees, which are
displayed in the Emacs view buffer.  The rules for
creating the views are also specified by similar data
structures and include the rules for building category
paths, sorting records and categories, calculating
the totals of category fields, filtering records, and
printing category tree and record lines.

3 Data Structures
*****************

`data-file'
     Name of the file that contains data.

`view-data-file'
     Name of the data file that contains the view descriptions.

`collector'
     Function that collects data from source other than data file, and
     sets the variable `ee-data'.

   Example of data structure:
     [(meta
       (format-version . "0.0.1")
       (database-version . "0.0.1")
       (data-version . "0.0.1")
       (data-file . "example.ee")
       (view-data-file . "view/example.ee")
       (collector . ee-example-data-collect)
       (fields
        (field (name name))
        (field (name category-1))
        (field (name category-2))
        (field (name category-3))
        (field (name (parent children)))
        (field (name ())))
       (key-fields name)
       (mark-field mark))
      ["ri-101" "c-1" nil "c-4" () ((price . 3.15) (amount . 9))]
      ["ri-102" "c-1/s-1" "c-2/s-2" "c-4" () ((price . 3) (amount . 5))]
      ["ri-103" "c-1" "c-3" "c-4" ((children "ri-104" "ri-105")) ()]
      ["ri-104" nil nil nil ((parent . "ri-103")) ()]
      ["ri-105" nil nil nil ((parent . "ri-104")) ()]]

4 View Description
******************

Views are described by data structures.

   Currently some fields are functions, where record fields are
accessed by function `ee-field', e.g. (ee-field 'field-name record).

   Current fields of view description data structure (functions that
begin with 'c-' prefix operate on categories, functions that begin with
'r-' prefix operate on records):

`name'
     Unique view name.

`r-filter'
     Function that selects the displayed records.

`c-path-finder'
     Function that converts every record to a list of category paths,
     which is used to build a category tree.

`c-sorter'
     Function that sorts the categories. Arguments are a-level (all
     levels), c-level (category-level), s-level (subcategory level),
     attr-alist (attributes list).

`r-sorter'
     Function that sorts the records. Arguments are a-level (all
     levels), r-level (record-level), attr-alist (attributes list).

`c-calculator'
     Function that calculates the category totals.

`r-calculator'
     Function that calculates the record totals.

`c-printer'
     Function that prints the category lines.

`r-printer'
     Function that prints the record lines.

`r-select'
     Function called after typing RET on a record line.

   Example of view description data structure:
     [(meta
       (format-version . "0.0.1")
       (view-data-file . "view/views.ee")
       (fields ()))
      [((type . view)

**********************

Marking and deleting viewed items.

   If some record appears under different categories, then it is marked
in all categories.

   If marking key is typed, when point is on category line, then the
whole category is marked, i.e. every record under this category is
marked.

10 Writing Extensions
*********************

You can write new ee extensions.

   To do it, follow the next steps:

  1. Create new file.
     Give it the name beginning with prefix `ee-'.

  2. Add default data description.
