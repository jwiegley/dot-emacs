The installation process with explanations (all files mentioned here are
relative to top-level directory "session/" in the distribution) for a
user-specific use (check the initial comment section of lisp/session.el
for a system- or distribution-wide installation):


 1. Copy file "lisp/session.el" to your load-path.  That means:

    Use C-h v load-path RET to check the value and the documentation of
    Emacs' load-path.

    You must copy "lisp/session.el" to one of the directories in the
    value list.  If no directory in the default value is appropriate,
    you must add "your own" directory to that list.

    The cases:

      (a) You want to copy the file to DIR, i.e., one of the listed
          directories: copy "lisp/session.el" to DIR.

      (b) You use Emacs and install Session in your home directory:
          create directory "~/.emacs.d/lisp/" and copy "lisp/session.el"
          to it.  Add the following lines at the beginning of your Emacs
          init file:

             (setq load-path
                   (cons (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/lisp") load-path))

      (c) You use XEmacs-20.3 or higher and install Session in your
          home directory: create directory
          "~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages/lisp/".  It will be automatically
          added to `load-path' if you start XEmacs the next time.

      (d) You install Session system-wide: the target directory is
          "EMACS/site-lisp/" or "XEMACS/site-packages/lisp/".  But you
          probably know that if you are responsible for Emacs or XEmacs
	  on your site.


 2. Byte-compile file "session.el": visit file "session.el" (that is,
    the copy) and use menu entry

       "Emacs-Lisp"/"Lisp" >> "Byte-compile This File"
    or
        M-x byte-compile-file RET session.el RET.

    Note: during compilation, you get warnings about missing functions.
    You can ignore them, since these functions will not be used in the
    Emacs/XEmacs branch or version you are using.


 3. Use Emacs' customization to enable package Session:

      (a) Start customization with M-x customize-group RET session RET
          or the menu [Options][Customize...]...[Data][Session].

      (b) Toggle the [Session Use Package] option to "in use".

      (c) Save your customization via [Save for future sessions].
