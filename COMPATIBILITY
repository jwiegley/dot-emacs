Running on macOS

We recommend the 24.5 build of GNU Emacs, which builds natively on macOS
(based on the NextStep port).  Binaries are available at various
websites (e.g., http://emacsformacosx.com), or you can build your own
by compiling from the FSF CVS. See the Emacs Wiki at
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsForMacOS for more.

Note that macOS compatibility isn't thoroughly tested.  If you discover
problems, please send a report and/or fix to the PG tracker.  Please
add tips to the wiki page above.
