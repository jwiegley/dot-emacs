The user interface is defined via glade.

glade/gtk seems to be a tool that is evolving, and getting the right
version to edit with is a problem.

If the version on your machine does not work, do the following

1. Install vagrant from http://vagrantup.com/

2. Start up the vagrant box

    $ vagrant box add base http://files.vagrantup.com/lucid32.box
    $ vagrant up
    $ ssh -p 2222 -X vagrant@localhost
      [password is vagrant]

3. In the vagrant box

    $ sudo apt-get install -y glade
    $ glade /vagrant/data/astview.glade &
    [ Note: it may fail with an X error the first time you run it, it runs fine after that]

The vagrant box has mounted the current directory in /vagrant, so any
changes you save will update the underlying project.

4. When you are done
    
    $ exit # from the vagrant box
    $ vagrant suspend
