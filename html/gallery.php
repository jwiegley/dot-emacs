<p>
Here are some publicity pictures for Proof General.  They were created
by David Aspinall in his spare time, using the excellent freeware
programs <a href="http://www.gimp.org">GIMP</a> and <a
href="http://www.blender.nl">Blender</a>.  The General himself is
based on a commercial mesh given away by 
<a href="http://www.viewpoint.com">Viewpoint</a>.
