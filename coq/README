========================================

Coq Proof General has experimental multiple file handling for 6.3
versions.  It does not have support for proof by pointing.

There is support for X Symbol, but not using a proper token language.

There is a tags program, coqtags.

========================================

Installation notes:

Check the values of coq-tags and coq-prog-name in coq.el to see that
they correspond to the paths for coqtop and the library on your system.

Install coqtags in a standard place or add <proof-home>/coq to your PATH.
NB: You may need to change the path to perl at the top of the file.

If you are running Coq, generate a TAGS file for the library by running
	coqtags `find . -name \*.v -print`
in the root directory of the library, $COQTOP/theories.  If you are
running LEGO, do the same using legotags in the appropriate directory.
