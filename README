Proof General --- Organize your proofs!
=======================================

Proof General is a generic Emacs interface for proof assistants.

This is version 3.2 of Proof General.   
(Check the About screen for precise version number).

The aim of the Proof General project is to provide a powerful and
configurable interfaces which help user-interaction with interactive
proof assistants.  Proof General targets power users rather than
novices, but we include general user interface niceties, such as
toolbar and menus, which make use easier for all.

Please help us with this aim!  Configure Proof General for your proof
assistant, by adding features at the generic level wherever possible.

NEWSFLASH: Proof General has been Emacs based so far, but plans are
afoot to liberate it from the points and parentheses of Emacs Lisp.
The successor framework, Proof General Kit, proposes that proof assistants
use a *standard* XML-based protocol for interactive proof, dubbed
PGIP.  PGIP will allow a middleware layer for many interactive proof
tools and interface components (including Emacs).  The design of PGIP
was made possible by the present Emacs-based Proof General framework.
