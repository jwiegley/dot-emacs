Subject: Proof General --- Version 3.2 release

            Announcing  Proof General  Version 3.2
    A Generic Emacs interface for Interactive Proof Assistants
                 http://www.proofgeneral.org

          contact: David Aspinall <da@proofgeneral.org>

Proof General is a generic (X)Emacs interface for proof assistants.
It can be instantiated for the proof assistant of your choice, and is
supplied ready-customised for Isabelle, Coq, LEGO, HOL, and AF2.

Proof General includes these features, amongst others:

. Script management: proof assistant state reflected in editor
. Toolbar and menus: commands for building and replaying proofs
. Syntax highlighting of proof scripts and prover output
. Display of real logical symbols, greek letters, etc
. Simplified communication: proof assistant verbosity hidden
. Menu for jumping to theorems in a proof script
. Provision to easily run proof assistant on a remote host
. Works on any platform Emacs does, in window system or plain console 

Summary of changes since 3.1:

. Support for new provers: AF2 (full) Twelf (in progress) 
. Each proof assistant now has its own menu with specific functions
. Documentation is now split into user manual and "adapting" manual
. Improvements in window management
. New commands, including parsing of error messages 
. Efficiency improvements
. Internal improvements: more flexible parsing and easier configuration
. Several bug fixes 
. For details, see http://www.proofgeneral.org/ProofGeneral-3.2/CHANGES

The user manual contains full details, and is available on-line at: 
http://www.proofgeneral.org/index.html?page=doc

Proof General needs a recent version of Emacs to run with, and it much
prefers XEmacs to FSF GNU Emacs.  Proof General 3.2 has been tested
with XEmacs 21.1 and Emacs 20.7.  (It may work back to XEmacs 20.4 and
Emacs 20.2, though).

Installing Proof General is easy.  Why not give it a try?
