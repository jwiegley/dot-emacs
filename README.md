Render a unified diff (top/bottom) in an easy-to-comprehend side-by-side
format.  This comes in handy for reading patches from mailing lists (or
from whencever you might acquire them).

### Installation


    M-x package-install diffview

### Usage


The following functions are provided for launching a side-by-side diff:

* `diffview-current` : View the current diff buffer side-by-side
* `diffview-region` : View the current diff region side-by-side
* `diffview-message` : View the current email message (which presumably
   contains a patch) side-by-side
