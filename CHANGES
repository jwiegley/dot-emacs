* Main Changes for Proof General 4.0 from 3.7.1

** Install/support changes

*** XEmacs is no longer supported; PG only works with GNU Emacs 22.2+

*** Primary distribution formats changed
    The RPM and zip file formats have been removed.
    We are very grateful to third-party packagers for Debian and Fedora
    for distributing packaged versions of PG.

** Generic changes

*** Font-lock based Unicode Tokens mode replaces X-Symbol
    Unicode Tokens has been significantly improved since PG 3.7.1,
    and now works purely at a "presentation" level without changing 
    buffer contents.  For best results, Emacs 23 is recommended.
    See Tokens menu for many useful commands.

*** Document-centred mechanisms added:
    - auto raise of prover output buffers can be disabled
    - output retained for script buffer popups
    - background colouring for locked region can be disabled
    - ...but "sticky" colouring for errors can be used
    - edit on processed region can automatically undo

    Depending on the prover language and interaction output, this may
    enable a useful "document centred" way of working, when output
    buffers can be ignored and hidden.  Use "full annotation" to keep
    output when several steps are taken.

    Standard values for the options can be set in one go with:
      Quick Options -> Display -> Document Centred
    and the defaults set back with 
      Quick Options -> Display -> Default. 
    See the manual for more details.

*** Automatic processing mode
      Quick Options -> Processing -> Send Automatically
    Sends commands to the prover when Emacs is idle for a while.
    This only sends commands when the last processing action has
    been an action moving forward through the buffer.  Interrupt by
    making a keyboard/mouse action.
    See the manual for more details.


*** Fast buffer processing option
      Quick Options -> Processing -> Fast Process Buffer
    This affects 'proof-process-buffer' (C-c C-b, toolbar down).
    It causes commands to be sent to the prover in a tight loop, without 
    updating the display or processing other input.  This speeds up
    processing dramatically on some Emacs implementations.
    To interrupt, use C-g, which reverts to normal processing mode.
    (To stop that, use C-c C-c as usual).

*** Improved prevention of Undo in locked region
    With thanks to Erik Martin-Dorel and Stefan Monnier.
    Undo in read only region follows `proof-strict-read-only' and
    gives the user the chance to allow edits by retracting first.

*** Proof General -> Options menu extended and rearranged
    - new menu for useful minor modes indicates modes that PG supports

*** New user configuration options (also on Proof General -> Options)
    proof-colour-locked       (use background colour for checked text)
    proof-auto-raise-buffers  (set to nil for manual window control)
    proof-full-decoration     (add full decoration to input text)
    proof-sticky-errors       (add highlighting for commands that caused error)
    proof-shell-quiet-errors  (non-nil to disable beep on error; default=nil)
    proof-minibuffer-messages (non-nil to show prover messages; default=nil)

*** Removed user configuration options
    proof-toolbar-use-button-enablers  (now always used)
    proof-output-fontify-enable        (now always enabled)

*** "Movie" output: export an annotated buffer in XML
    Basic movie output for Proviola, see http://mws.cs.ru.nl/proviola

** Isabelle/Isar changes

*** Support undo back into completed proofs (linear_undo).

*** Electric terminator works without inserting terminator
    Hit ; to process the last command.  Easier than C-RET.

*** Line numbers reported during script management

*** Sync problems with bad input prevented by command wrapping

*** Isabelle Settings now organised in sub-menus

** Coq changes

*** Only supports Coq 8.1+, support for earlier versions dropped.

*** Holes mode can be turned on/off and has its own minor mode

*** Some keyboard shortcuts are now available in goals buffer
    C-c C-a C-<c,p,o,b,a> are now available in goal buffer.

*** Experimental storing buffer
    To store the content of response or goals buffer in a dedicated
    persistent buffer (for later use), use Coq/Store response or
    Coq/Store goal.

*** bug fixes, bugs
    - Three panes mode: "window would be too small" error fixed.
    - Indentation: several error fixed. If you want to indent tactics
    inside "Instance" or "Add Parametric Relation" etc, please put
    "Proof." before the tactics, there is no way for emacs to guess
    wether these commands initiate new goals or not.
    - coq prog args permanent settings is working again
    - when a proof is completed, the goals buffer is cleared again.

** Notable internal changes

*** Altered prover configuration settings (internal)

    proof-terminal-char replaced by proof-terminal-string

    urgent message matching is now anchored; configurations for
    `proof-shell-clear-response-regexp', etc, must match
    strings which begin with `proof-shell-eager-annotation-start'.

    proof-shell-strip-output-markup: added for cut-and-paste
    proof-electric-terminator-noterminator: allows non-insert of terminator

    pg-insert-output-as-comment-fn: removed (use p-s-last-output)
    proof-shell-wakeup-char: removed (special chars deprecated)
    pg-use-specials-for-fontify: removed (ditto)
    proof-shell-prompt-pattern: removed (was only for shell UI)
    proof-shell-abort-goal-regexp: removed (ordinary response)
    proof-shell-error-or-interrupt-seen: removed, use p-s-last-output-kind
    proof-script-next-entity-regexps,next-entity-fn: removed (func-menu dead)

*** Simplified version of comint now used for proof shell (internal)
    To improve efficiency, a cut-down version of comint is now used.
    Editing, history and decoration in the shell (*coq*, *isabelle*,
    etc) are impoverished compared with PG 3.X.
