* Summary of Changes for Proof General 3.5 from 3.4

** Generic changes

*** Support for Speedbar and Index menu ("Imenu")

Imenu is an alternative to Function Menu (which has been supported for
some time, but is not built-in to GNU Emacs).  It displays a menu of
named definitions, theorems, etc, in the file and allows quick
navigation to them.

Speedbar displays a file tree in a separate window on the display,
allowing quick navigation.  Middle/double-clicking or pressing + on a
file icon opens up to display tags (definitions, theorems, etc) within
the file.  Middle/double-clicking on a file or tag jumps to that file/tag.

To use Imenu, select Proof General -> Options -> Index Menu.  This adds
an "Index" menu to the main menu bar.  You can also use M-x imenu for
keyboard-driven completion.

To use Speedbar, use Tools -> Display Speedbar (GNU Emacs), or
Proof General -> Advanced -> Speedbar (XEmacs).  Or if you prefer
the old fashioned way, `M-x speedbar' does the same job.

For more about Speedbar, see http://cedet.sourceforge.net/speedbar.shtml

*** Improved display management

The display handling functions have been overhauled to cope with
latest API changes and diversions between Emacs versions.  Multiframe
mode should now work on both Emacs versions, with cut-down frames (no
toolbars, etc).  There is a new user-level function
`proof-layout-windows' which displays windows in a default form for
the current display mode.  This uses a vertical-horizontal split
scheme for three-pane mode (due to Pierre Courtieu), but three-pane
mode also works with three-way horizontal split as before.

*** More example proofs included

Some additional example proofs are included with this release (and we
hope to add more).  The best and most accurate resource is of course
the distribution of each proof assistant, but including some samples
in Proof General allows you to see proofs in other systems without
having to install them all.

The "root2" example proofs of the irrationality of the square root of
2 were proofs written as a response to a challenge of Freek Wiedijk in
his comparison of different theorem provers, see
http://www.cs.kun.nl/~freek/comparison/.  Those proof scripts are
copyright by their named authors.


*** Improved RPM packages

Three packages are provided: ProofGeneral, ProofGeneral-emacs-elc and
ProofGeneral-xemacs-elc.  The two elc RPMs contain compiled elisp for
GNU Emacs and XEmacs respectively.  These RPMs are intended to be
compatible with the RPMs distributed with Red Hat/Fedora. 

Please try out these packages and report any problems.

*** Desktop integration on freedesktop.org compliant desktops

Provided automatically (and only) with the RPM package.
Please send in i18n strings, and report any problems on particular
desktops (only tested on Fedora Core 1/GNOME).

*** Keyboard hints and other messages displayed in minibuffer

Hints for keyboard usage and reporting on file processing are now
displayed in the minibuffer.  If you do not like this behaviour,
customize the `pg-show-hints' variable.

*** pre-compiled .elc files. NOTE: recompile needed for GNU Emacs

Proof General can now be reliably run as compiled code.

However, compiled Emacs Lisp files sometimes have incompatibilities
between versions (and definitely between GNU Emacs and XEmacs).  To
recompile the sources for a particular Emacs version, try:

  make clean
  make compile
 
Check the settings in the Makefile for your Emacs version.

*** Bundling of X-Symbol Mode (4.5.1-beta)

To disable use of the bundled version, either delete/move away the
x-symbol subdirectory, or load your own local version first [put
(require 'x-symbol-hooks) in .emacs, or unpack in your own .xemacs
directory].

From now on, PG is not backward compatible with previous X-Symbol
versions.  Either upgrade your installed version, or be careful to
load PG first (so that the bundled version of X-Symbol is used).

Notice that the package version of X-Symbol may load itself first by
default during XEmacs startup (especially if you have it installed
site-wide), so it may be tricky to override.  You can prevent this
with "xemacs -no-autoloads", but that may result in other needed
packages not being loaded!  There seems to be no good way around this
provided in XEmacs.  In case of problems, consult your sysadmin to try
to prevent global loading of x-symbol.

*** Bundling of MMM Mode (for multiple modes in one buffer)

MMM mode allows submodes to be used in the same file.
See http://mmm-mode.sourceforge.net/.
At present it is configured for Isar, to allow LaTeX and sml-mode to
be used inside Isar scripts.  Contributions of configuration for other
provers welcomed.

*** X-Symbol (and MMM-mode) minor mode behaviour simplified
 
These minor modes like to be responsible for turning themselves on and
off.  PG does not anymore try to synchronise the on/off settings in
all PG buffers (which could lead to half an hour of fontification!).
Instead the menu reflects the current minor mode status; toggling it
will also update the default "global for PG" behaviour for new script
buffers.

*** Movement of cursor on interrupt is disabled

By default, the cursor jumps to the end of the locked region on an
error.  Previously it also jumped on an interrupt.  This is configurable
via `proof-shell-handle-error-or-interrupt-hook', which see.

After an interrupt you may use C-c . to move to the end of the
locked region, or C-c ` (backquote) to move to the location 
given by an error message from the prover.  

*** Automatic slow-down on fast tracing display

Proof General will try to configure itself to update the display of
tracing output infrequently when the prover is producing rapid,
perhaps voluminous, output.  This counteracts the situation that
otherwise Emacs may consume more CPU than the proof assistant, trying
to fontify and refresh the display as fast as output appears.
See `proof-trace-output-slow-catchup' for setting.


*** Proof General -> Options menu changes

**** Improvement to options handling

Facility to reset to default values added, and saving
of (just) proof assistant settings.

**** Strict read only added

Strict read only behaviour for the locked (blue) region
can now be enabled/disabled without restarting scripting.
(Output hightlighting option has been removed from this menu,
but is still available under 
   Advanced -> Customize -> User Options -> ..

**** Deactivate Action added 

This setting controls an automatic action when scripting is
deactivated in a partially processed buffer.  Ordinarily, PG will
query whether to retract or completely process the file.
One of these can be chosen as a default action.

**** Follow mode: add "followdown" setting

In this mode, the point moves with the locked region when it moves
down in the buffer (processing).  For undo, the point does not move.

**** Display management: added shrink-windows-tofit option

This option shrinks and expands the display of prover output,
within reasonable window sizes, when in 2-window mode.  It avoids
wasting half the screen with empty space (with the drawback
of moving the boundary up and down).

Available under PG -> Options -> Display -> Shrink To Fit.

*** Add proof-indent-pad-eol setting to prettify locked regions in XEmacs.

This works by adding unnecessary spaces to the end of lines when TAB
is pressed.

*** Parsing internals changed: minor user visible differences

Please report any problems/annoyances which may be unexpected.
NB: Not yet enabled for Isabelle/Isar.

*** Tweaks to menus,  colours

Electric terminator menu option more visible. 
Reduce contrast for mouse highlighting of regions.

*** Added `proof-shell-identifier-under-mouse-cmd'

Allows PG to conveniently send a command to the prover which passes
the identifier under the mouse, or the active region, as an argument.
Bound globally to Control-Meta-Mouse-button1.

Presently only configured in Isabelle/Isar, to parse terms (inside
strings) and theorems (outside).




** GNU Emacs compatibility, simplified font-lock, handling nested comments

*** Numerous improvements, thanks due to Stefan Monnier.

*** Some GNU Emacs backwards compatibility removed: use 21.1 or later

** Changes for Isabelle

*** Automatic refreshing of Logics list

*** Theorem dependencies: displaying and highlighting dependencies.

Dependencies for a theorem (i.e. other theorems,lemmas) can be
displayed.  Local dependencies within the same file can be highlighted
in yellow, and places where a theorem is used are highlighted in
orange.  This aids editing of theories to remove dead lemmas, re-order
proofs, etc.  To activate it you need to select the "Theorem
Dependencies" option in the Isabelle(/Isar) -> Settings menu.  

You may need to restart the prover before doing this to gather full
dependency information.

*** Beginnings of support PGIP protocol (wip with Isabelle2004)  

This is an internal change.  Presently, it allows Isabelle to
configure Proof General prover settings menu directly rather 
than using Elisp.


** Changes for Coq

*** Indentation improved

*** Menu entries for commands, tactics and terms

*** "Holes" system, for editing structured expressions

Holes are a powerful feature for complex expression editing. It is
inspired from other tools, like Pcoq
(http://www-sop.inria.fr/lemme/pcoq/index.html). The principle is
simple, holes are pieces of text that can be "filled" by different
means. The new menu system makes use of the holes system. Almost all
holes operations are available in the Coq/holes menu.

Note: Holes and menus make use of emacs abbreviation mechanism, please
make sure you don't have an abbrev table defined in you config files
(C-h v abbrev-file-name to see the name of the abbreviation file). If
there is already such a table, you can do the following to merge with
ProofGeneral's abbrev: M-x read-abbrev-file, then find the file named
"coq-abbrev.el" in the ProofGeneral/coq directory. At emacs exit you
will be asked if you want to save abbrevs, answer yes.

*** X-symbols are much improved (more symbols, cleaner grammar)

Symbols are encoded only if between spaces or _'s. Sub/superscripts
are now introduced by '__' and '^^' respectively, and the rest of the
word is sub/superscripted.  To put spaces inside sub/superscripts, use
_{...} or ^{...}. Notice that this last syntax is not understood by
Coq and you will need to defined it with the "Notation" command of
Coq.


** Additional instances of Proof General

*** ccc:  Proof General for the Casl Consistency Checker

Provided by Christoph Lüth <cxl@informatik.uni-bremen.de>.
See http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/cofi/ccc for more information.

*** pgshell:  Proof General for shell scripts/simple command interpreters.

This instance of PG is handy just for using script management to
cut-and-paste into a buffer running an ordinary shell or tool
with a command-line interpreter of some kind.  

Provides an instant and cheap interface to command-line interpreters,
to avoid tiresomely using cut-and-paste to run pre-recorded commands.
