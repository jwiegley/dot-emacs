* Summary of Changes for Proof General 3.3 from 3.2

** Generic Changes

*** Proof General startup script welcomes user
 
     The "binary" (startup script) bin/proofgeneral now loads
     PG and invokes a function to display a splash message,
     which invites the user to load a file.   A bit more
     friendly than simply being confronted by a standard 
     XEmacs screen.

*** Changes to Proof General RPM packaging mechanism
  
     Can now build RPM packages with "rpm -ta" from tarball source.
     RPM includes menu file and icons (tested under Linux Mandrake).

*** Addition of visibility control for completed proofs

     You can make proofs invisible using a context sensitive menu
     (right button on a completed proof), or as soon as they are
     completed with the "Options -> Disappearing Proofs" option.
     To reveal all proofs again, use the "Make proofs visible"
     command.

     [ in progress, feedback welcome ]

*** Command to insert last output as comment in proof script.

     Sometimes it is useful to paste some of the output from
     goals or response buffer into the proof script.  A new
     function `pg-insert-last-output-as-comment' (C-c C-;)
     inserts the last output and converts it into a comment
     using `comment-region'.

*** Compatibility fixes.

     Fixes for FSF Emacs and XEmacs 21.4

** Coq Changes

     Compatibility for V7 added.

     Experimental enhancements to handling of compiled files and 
     file dependency:

     1) At the end of scripting foo.v (i.e. when activing scripting is
     switched off), "Reset Initial. Compile Module <foo>" is
     automatically issued. This clears the context and writes a .vo file,
     to keep your .vo files up to date. It means that when using PG Coq, 
     you should use the correct commands ("Require foo.") to load all
     the modules you depend on, so that scripting can continue in the
     next file.

** Changes for developers to note

*** proof-shell-process-output now sets proof-shell-last-output and
    proof-shell-last-output-kind which gives clearer interface internally
    and with rest of code.   See docs.
