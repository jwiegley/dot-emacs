;; Also know as the "wish list".  Some are done. For the others, no
;; promise when to be implemented.

* Use a new custom type (`define-widget') for posting-style in `gnus-cus.el'
  (G c) and for `gnus-posting-styles'.  Maybe some allowed types are still
  missing.

* Add proper doc strings to functions and variables explained in the manual
  (info "(gnus)Gnus Utility Functions")

* Add Message-IDs or URLs refering to relevant discussions on lists and
  newsgroups.

* Use nicer tool bar icons from GNOME

  Done for Emacs (The GNOME icons won't fit into standard XEmacs icons,
  IMHO. -- rsteib) in group, summary and message mode.

  Some modes might also deserve improved tool bars:

  - gnus-draft-mode

  - mml-preview buffer:

    . zap most buttons; except print, customize (?) and help

    . "exit" should just kill the buffer

  - gnus-server-mode: Add some commands from the Connections and Server
    menu.

  - gnus-browse-mode (could borrow some icons from gnus-group-mode)

  (See http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.gnus.general/62147).

* Maybe Gnus should support the LIST SUBSCRIPTIONS, see RFC 2980.

* Merge `message-extra-wide-headers' and ` message-header-synonyms'?

* Maybe texi/emacs-mime.texi could be divided into user-visible stuff and
  reference manual for the MIME library.

  Related: Bill Wohler's article on mh-e-user.
  http://thread.gmane.org/29067.1138078896@olgas.newt.com

* Fix `change servers' command, see David Kastrup's message.
  http://thread.gmane.org/x54qewqxz4.fsf@lola.goethe.zz

* texi/gnus-coding.texi should be fixed.

* gnus-topic-kill-region
  From Colin Marquardt <colin.marquardt@usa.alcatel.com>

  I noticed that when re-arranging topics, C-k yanks a topic just fine
  (runs gnus-topic-kill-group).

  However, my habit is to do marking and the yanking the region, so I
  would run C-w on the marked topic. But C-w runs
  gnus-group-kill-region and doesn't yank the topic (for groups it
  works fine).

  So could we have a gnus-topic-kill-region, or a
  gnus-group-kill-region which handles topics as well?

* Speed up sorting in summary buffer if there is a limit.

  Suggested by Daniel Ortmann <ortmann@isl.net>.

* Investigate the memory usage of Gnus. 

  But it does seem strange that Gnus would use some 15meg for this.  I
  think that is worth investigating.  I suspect that bugs or bad
  design are causing waste; they could be in Gnus, or in Emacs. -- RMS

* Google group digest

  The result of Google group search return a thread. Is it a digest
  format?

* NOV caching.

  Implement NOV caching with Gnus Agent.

* Allow specification of server in Newsgroups header

  [Kai wrote]

  WIBNI I could put `Newsgroups: nntp+quimby:bla' into a message and
  Gnus would know to post this message on my server `nntp:quimby' into
  the group bla?  I think this would be way cool.

  But Gnus would have to rewrite the Newsgroups header before actually
  sending the posting.

  Thanks for Micha Wiedenmann for this suggestion.

* Parsing of the subscription notice to stash away details like what
   address you're subscribed to the list under (and automatically send
   mail to the list using that address, when you send mail inside the list
   group), what address to mail to unsubscribe, and the list info message
   if available.  Hitting the "get FAQ" command inside a mailing list
   group should display that stashed copy of the info message.

* Some help in coming up with good split rules for mailing lists, as
   automated as possible.  Splitting on To and Cc is almost always not
   what I want, since it can misfile messages and since if I'm cc'd on
   list mail I want to get both copies, one in my personal mailbox and one
   in the list mailbox.  I know other people handle it other ways, but I
   prefer it that way.  Accordingly, some way to semi-automatically
   generate split rules based on Sender, Mailing-List, Return-Path,
   X-Loop, and all of the other random headers that often work would be
   very cool.

* Agent:

* A better interface to the agent download scoring rules, like the one
  for the other scoring rules.

* Editing of messages in the agents cache.
  
* Support for encrypted folders. Even if the mail arrives unencrypted
  Gnus should be able to encrypt the *folder* for added safety. This
  should go for both Gnus' own folders and the folders Gnus reads from
  (e.g. /var/spool/mail/${USER}). All backends this makes sense for.

  [John Wiegley's article <200011030445.VAA08277@localhost.dynodns.net>,
   posted on gnu.emacs.gnus does this.
   Also, gnus-article-encrypt `K E' encrypts the article body.]

* Splitting .newsrc.eld so the history is in one file and the
  configuration is in another. To help those that reads at two
  locations (e.g. work and home) and want to have the same
  configuration.

* Additional article marking, and an ability to affect marks placed
  during e.g. mail acquisition.  I want to be able to notice the
  subject "fast money" or "web traffic", automatically mark it with a
  `$', and score it into oblivion.  (But I fear that wanting to change
  marks with mail-source-* and nnmail-* functions will represent a
  philosophical conflict with the rest of Gnus' management of article
  marks.  mail-source-* and nnmail-* currently hack around with files
  under ~/Mail and leave traces in ~/Mail/active, but don't affect
  things stored in .newsrc.eld.)

* A much better interface to nnmail-split-methods.  I don't know how
  I'd like this done, but I know that the current method of manually
  hacking regexps is pretty untenable for new users.  My boss, who is
  tenured faculty at CMU and CEO & CTO at JPRC, and whose research
  work has involved Lisp for the last 25 years, is trying to implant
  himself in a Gnus mail environment, and this is a big sticking point
  even for him.

* PGP-supported encryption of entire nnml & nnmh groups.  There are
  people with whom I exchange mail routinely who don't send w/PGP, but
  I'd really rather that the content not be left lying around
  unencrypted.  Hook into article acquisition the way jka-compr
  supposedly does, to auto-decrypt every message read.

  [See Support for encrypted folders.]

* Baby's First Mail In Gnus.  Some set of functions that the
  new-to-mail-in-Gnus user can invoke which will query the user
  appropriately for the basic information required to establish mail
  handling, leaving the appropriate traces in .gnus.  Perhaps a
  customize buffer would be appropriate.
  - Where does your mail come from?
  - If some server, what is your POP/IMAP protocol identity?
  - What is your identity when sending mail, as opposed to posting to
    Usenet?
  - Here are some basic concepts of mail groups (list a few:
    personal mail, company-wide mail, mailing lists, garbage dumps,
    receptacles for outbound copies of what one sends; which ones do
    you want to instantiate, and what mail should land in each?
    [/viz./ problem of nnmail-split-methods interface.]

  [Probably `assistant.el' will provide this.  But it's development is
  stalled.]

* Manual ordering of articles in an nnml folder.

  That is, keystrokes to move articles (or whole threads) up or down
  in the *Summary* buffer relative to the other articles.  The order
  would be persistent (e.g., across gnus sessions).

  With this ability, an nnml folder would make for a good to-do list.

* Since many uses Gnus to store to do lists I think it is time for an
  nntodo. (I know Kai already written one, maybe use that for a start?)

* nnsql backend, which would allow messages or folders to be imported
  in a local (My|Postgre|?)SQL RDBMS.

* "posting profiles" ideally accessible from a popup menu; allowing
  choice between predefined profiles of
  from,name,organization,etc. Example: I'm at home, but need to reply
  to a work mail; i can hit 'R', then use this command to switch to my
  'work' profile for purposes of this one reply. (This might already
  be possible with current Gnus, but I don't think so.)

* Better handling of the mail retrieving / splitting feature:
  - the variables <backend>-get-new-mail should not exist anymore. Mail
    retrieving should be a separate matter.
  - we should be able to split mails to groups AND backends at the same time.
  - meanwhile, we should still be able to associate certain mail sources with
    certain backends.

* More article marks (like '!' or '?').
  Maybe user defined marks that can be displayed as any choosen charakter,
  so one could do things like limiting on, to do whatever one likes with
  these articles.

* Allow article editing in groups which do not support it, but
  emulating it via deleting the old article and entering the new one
  into the group.  This would be very useful to support `T ^' (say) in
  nnimap groups.

* Allow user to specify which kinds of groups should be displayed.
  For example, I want to display all the groups that are displayed
  now, plus those which have cached messages in them.  (Gnus does
  display those with ticked messages but not those with
  cached-but-unticked ones.)  This would become even more important
  when we allow labels.

* Create new data type `article identifier' and use that instead of
  article numbers.  A first implementation could offer something like
  (num . 4711) but this could be extended.  This would be useful for
  using servers with *really* large numbers -- there we could have a
  bignum type.  It might also be useful for the nnweb and nnultimate
  thingies where article identifiers are not really numbers.

* Allow use of digests to keep related articles.  Normally, you use
  groups to group together articles which are thematically related.
  But sometimes, you have so many themes that this becomes
  impractical.  WIBNI I could have digests in a group, and there was a
  way to add a new article to one of the digests in that group?

  Or maybe what I really want is a way to tell Gnus that a specific
  thread should always be hidden (as in `T h') by default, while most
  other threads are not hidden by default.  Hm.

* New backend nnbabylfolder.  There is also nnbabyl which is like
  nnmbox but uses babyl format, but there is no babyl format
  equivalent of nnfolder.

* Make movement commands in summary buffer independent of `move after
  mark' behavior when marking articles.  Currently, if you don't want
  `E' to move to the next unread article, you have to set
  gnus-summary-goto-unread to nil, and then there is no way to move to
  the next or previous unread article.

  This one has two sub-tasks.  Providing the commands is one thing,
  finding out useful key bindings for them is another.  I think we
  could provide the commands first while not changing the behavior of
  the key bindings; then different people can experiment with
  different key binding schemes until we find something which suits
  many people.

* `Move to next/previous/first article' is a misnomer, since ticked
  articles are also unread but not moved to by these commands.  Should
  the terminology be fixed or the documentation, or what?

* Allow sorting of threads by newest article rather than by root of
  thread.  Consider the following thread structure:

    root1       Jan 1
      leaf1     Jan 4
    root2       Jan 2
      leaf2     Jan 3

  These two threads are sorted this way because root1 is older than
  root2.  I want an option to sort them the other way round because
  leaf1 is newer than leaf2.

* Improve editing of MIME messages.  I would like to use html-mode to
  edit the body of a text/html message, and enriched-mode for
  text/enriched messages, and so on.  This should go for multipart
  messages as well.  This is probably a hard one since Emacs currently
  does not allow several major modes per buffer.  But maybe it would
  be nice to hack Emacs to provide this infrastructure so that Gnus
  can make use of it?  This would also make it possible to provide
  nifty commands for editing the headers, for example, rather than
  relying on commands which do the same thing everywhere.
  message-x.el is really just a half-assed attempt at doing it, and
  while it is useful, that's not the way it should be done.

  I think Francisco Potort,Al(B already did something like this?

* Provide commands for editing MML tags.  For example, there could be
  a command mml-add-tag-attribute which prompts me for an attribute
  name (with completion, from the set filename, type, ...), and then
  for a value.  (This is like `C-c +' in psgml.)  Or there could be a
  command which showed me all the attributes in an MML tag and allows
  me to use TAB to move between them, and then to edit each attribute
  value.  (This is like `C-c C-a' in psgml.)

* Have Gnus automagically set group parameters for mailing list
  groups.  For example, if I have a splitting rule that automatically
  sorts ding@gnus.org into mail.ding, then Gnus should clue in, set
  the to-list parameter to 'ding@gnus.org', and set total-expire.
  (This is probably Hard (TM).  And of course the user should be able
  to configure what parameters exactly get set.)

* Along the same lines, automagically detect broken reply-to's.  (But
  don't auto-detect users legitimately setting a reply-to header that
  points back to the list.)

* Make it easier to change parameters on a set of groups,
  e.g. set/clear gcc-self on process-marked groups.

* Make it easier/possible to migrate between primary select-methods,
  if that concept is going to be kept.  Right now I have only one
  group on my primary server, and I'd kind of like to change from nntp
  to nnml, but apparently this doesn't work well.

* Make it possible to refer to uniquely-named groups without
  select-method prefix (e.g. mail.misc instead of nnml:mail.misc).

* Annotations as discussed last autumn. Be able to make comments to
  articles for all backends. The comments maybe should go into a
  seperate "backend", like nndraft.

* Catchup on a topic and all its subtopics. I.e. do "c y" when on a
  topic line in *Group*.

* Better/more advanced subject washing in *Summary*, see my
  js-gnus-simplify-subject-function I posted earlier this winter.

exceeding lisp nesting on huge groups.

*  expunged articles are counted when computing scores.

*  ticked articles aren't easy to read in pick mode - `n' and stuff
 just skips past them.  Read articles are the same.

*  topics that contain just groups with ticked articles aren't
 displayed.

*  nndoc should always allocate unique Message-IDs.

*  If there are mail groups the first time you use Gnus, Gnus'll

*  `T h' should jump to the parent topic and fold it.

*  a command to create an ephemeral nndoc group out of a file, and
 then splitting it/moving it to some other group/backend.

*  It should also probably be possible to delimit what
 `gnus-jog-cache' does - for instance, work on just some groups, or
 on some levels, and entering just articles that have a score
 higher than a certain number.

*  nnfolder should append to the folder instead of re-writing the
 entire folder to disk when accepting new messages.

*  a backend for reading collections of babyl files nnbabylfolder?

*  a command for making the native groups into foreign groups.

*  server mode command for clearing read marks from all groups from

 each copy can be edited separately.

*  nnweb should allow fetching from the local nntp server.

*  record the sorting done in the summary buffer so that it can be
 repeated when limiting/regenerating the buffer.

*  nnml-generate-nov-databses should generate for all nnml servers.

*  when the user does commands in the group buffer, check the
 modification time of the .newsrc.eld file and use

 the nntp server instead of relying on the active hashtb.

*  buttonize the output of `C-c C-a' in an apropos-like way.

*  `G p' should understand process/prefix, and allow editing of
 several groups at once.

*  command to create an ephemeral nnvirtual group that matches some
 regexp(s).

*  it should be possible to score "thread" on the From header.

*  hitting RET on a "gnus-uu-archive" pseudo article should unpack
 it.

*  `B i' should display the article at once in the summary buffer.

*  remove the "*" mark at once when unticking an article.

*  `M-s' should highlight the matching text.

*  when checking for duplicated mails, use Resent-Message-ID if
 present.

*  killing and yanking groups in topics should be better.  If
 killing one copy of a group that exists in multiple topics, only
 that copy should be removed.  Yanking should insert the copy, and
 yanking topics should be possible to be interspersed with the
 other yankings.

*  command for enter a group just to read the cached articles.  A
 way to say "ignore the nntp connection; just read from the cache."

*  a way to hide all "inner" cited text, leaving just the most
 recently cited text.

*  nnvirtual should be asynchronous.

*  after editing an article, gnus-original-article-buffer should be
 invalidated.

*  there should probably be a way to make Gnus not connect to the
 server and just read the articles in the server

*  allow a `set-default' (or something) to change the default value
 of nnoo variables.

*  a command to import group infos from a .newsrc.eld file.

*  groups from secondary servers have the entire select method
 listed in each group info.

*  a command for just switching from the summary buffer to the group
 buffer.

*  a way to specify that some incoming mail washing functions should
 only be applied to some groups.

*  Message `C-f C-t' should ask the user whether to heed
 mail-copies-to: never.

*  new group parameter - `post-to-server' that says to post using
 the current server.  Also a variable to do the same.

*  the slave dribble files should auto-save to the slave file names.

*  a group parameter that says what articles to display on group
 entry, based on article marks.

*  a way to visually distinguish slave Gnusae from masters.  (Whip
 instead of normal logo?)

*  Use DJ Bernstein "From " quoting/dequoting, where applicable.

*  Why is hide-citation-maybe and hide-citation different?  Also
 clear up info.

*  group user-defined meta-parameters.

*  I like the option for trying to retrieve the FAQ for a group and
 I was thinking it would be great if for those newsgroups that had
 archives you could also try to read the archive for that group.
 Part of the problem is that archives are spread all over the net,
 unlike FAQs.  What would be best I suppose is to find the one
 closest to your site.

 In any case, there is a list of general news group archives at
 ftp://ftp.neosoft.com/pub/users/claird/news.lists/newsgroup_archives.html

*      From: Jason L Tibbitts III <tibbs@hpc.uh.edu>
      (add-hook 'gnus-select-group-hook
	(lambda ()
	  (gnus-group-add-parameter group
	     (cons 'gnus-group-date-last-entered (list (current-time-string))))))

      (defun gnus-user-format-function-d (headers)
	"Return the date the group was last read."
	(cond ((car (gnus-group-get-parameter gnus-tmp-group 'gnus-group-date-last-entered)))
	    (t "")))

*  tanken var at n,Ae(Br du bruker `gnus-startup-file' som prefix (FOO)
 til ,Ae(B lete opp en fil FOO-SERVER, FOO-SERVER.el, FOO-SERVER.eld,
 kan du la den v,Af(Bre en liste hvor du bruker hvert element i listen
 som FOO, istedet.  da kunne man hatt forskjellige serveres
 startup-filer forskjellige steder.

* LMI> Well, nnbabyl could alter the group info to heed labels like
 LMI> answered and read, I guess.

 It could also keep them updated (the same for the Status: header of
 unix mbox files).

 They could be used like this:

      `M l <name> RET' add label <name> to current message.
      `M u <name> RET' remove label <name> from current message.
      `/ l <expr> RET' limit summary buffer according to <expr>.

      <expr> would be a boolean expression on the labels, e.g.

      `/ l bug & !fixed RET'

 would show all the messages which are labeled `bug' but not labeled
 `fixed'.

 One could also imagine the labels being used for highlighting, or
 affect the summary line format.

 I'd like a gnus-find-file which work like find file, except that it
 would recognize things that looks like messages or folders:

 - If it is a directory containing numbered files, create an nndir
 summary buffer.

 - For other directories, create a nneething summary buffer.

 - For files matching "\\`From ", create a nndoc/mbox summary.

 - For files matching "\\`BABYL OPTIONS:", create a nndoc/baby
 summary.

 - For files matching "\\`[^ \t\n]+:", create an *Article* buffer.

 - For other files, just find them normally.

 I'd like `nneething' to use this function, so it would work on a
 directory potentially containing mboxes or babyl files.

* Currently, I get prompted:

 decend into sci?  - type y decend into sci.something ?  - type n
 decend into ucd?

 The problem above is that since there is really only one
 subsection of science, shouldn't it prompt you for only descending
 sci.something?  If there was a sci.somethingelse group or section,
 then it should prompt for sci? first the sci.something? then
 sci.somethingelse?...

* Ja, det burde v,Af(Bre en m,Ae(Bte ,Ae(B si slikt.  Kanskje en ny variabel?
 `gnus-use-few-score-files'?  S,Ae(B kunne score-regler legges til den
 "mest" lokale score-fila.  F. eks. ville no-gruppene betjenes av
 "no.all.SCORE", osv.

* What i want is for Gnus to treat any sequence or combination of
 the following as a single spoiler warning and hide it all,
 replacing it with a "Next Page" button:

 ^L's

 more than n blank lines

 more than m identical lines (which should be replaced with button
 to show them)

 any whitespace surrounding any of the above

* Well, we could allow a new value to `gnus-thread-ignore-subject' -
 `spaces', or something.  (We could even default to that.)  And then
 subjects that differ in white space only could be considered the
 "same" subject for threading purposes.

* Modes to preprocess the contents (e.g. jka-compr) use the second
 form "(REGEXP FUNCTION NON-NIL)" while ordinary modes (e.g. tex)
 use the first form "(REGEXP . FUNCTION)", so you could use it to
 distinguish between those two types of modes. (auto-modes-alist,
 insert-file-contents-literally.)

*  Under XEmacs - do funny article marks: tick - thumb tack killed -
 skull soup - bowl of soup score below - dim light bulb score over
 - bright light bulb

* Yes. I think the algorithm is as follows:

      Group-mode

	 show-list-of-articles-in-group
	      if (key-pressed == SPACE)
		      if (no-more-articles-in-group-to-select)
			      if (articles-selected)
				      start-reading-selected-articles;
			      junk-unread-articles;
			      next-group;
		       else
			      show-next-page;

	       else if (key-pressed = '.')
		      if (consolidated-menus)         # same as hide-thread in Gnus
			      select-thread-under-cursor;
		      else
			      select-article-under-cursor;


      Article-mode
	      if (key-pressed == SPACE)
		      if (more-pages-in-article)
			      next-page;
		      else if (more-selected-articles-to-read)
			      next-article;
		      else
			      next-group;

* My precise need here would have been to limit files to Incoming*.
 One could think of some `nneething-only-files' variable, but I
 guess it would have been unacceptable if one was using many
 unrelated such nneething groups.

 A more useful approach would be to, in response to the `G D'
 prompt, be allowed to say something like: `~/.mail/Incoming*',
 somewhat limiting the top-level directory only (in case
 directories would be matched by the wildcard expression).

*    Take a look at w3-menu.el in the Emacs-W3 distribution - this
 works out really well.  Each menu is 'named' by a symbol that
 would be on a gnus-*-menus (where * would be whatever, but at
 least group, summary, and article versions) variable.

 So for gnus-summary-menus, I would set to '(sort mark dispose ...)

 A value of '1' would just put _all_ the menus in a single 'GNUS'
 menu in the main menubar.  This approach works really well for
 Emacs-W3 and VM.

*  nndoc should take care to create unique Message-IDs for all its
 articles.

*  gnus-score-followup-article only works when you have a summary
 buffer active.  Make it work when posting from the group buffer as
 well.  (message-sent-hook).

*  * Enhancements to Gnus:

 Add two commands:

 * gnus-servers (gnus-start-server-buffer?)-enters Gnus and goes
 straight to the server buffer, without opening any connections to
    servers first.

 * gnus-server-read-server-newsrc-produces a buffer very similar to
    the group buffer, but with only groups from that server listed;
    quitting this buffer returns to the server buffer.

*  add a command to check the integrity of an nnfolder folder - go
 through the article numbers and see that there are no duplicates,
 and stuff.

*  a command to give all relevant info on an article, including all
 secondary marks.

*  when doing `-request-accept-article', the backends should do the
 nnmail duplicate checking.

*  cache the newsgroups file locally to avoid reloading it all the
 time.

*  a command to import a buffer into a group.

*  point in the article buffer doesn't always go to the beginning of
 the buffer when selecting new articles.

*  a command to process mark all unread articles.

*  `gnus-gather-threads-by-references-and-subject' - first do
 gathering by references, and then go through the dummy roots and
 do more gathering by subject.

*  gnus-uu-mark-in-numerical-order - process mark articles in
 article numerical order.

*  (gnus-thread-total-score  (gnus-id-to-thread (mail-header-id
 (gnus-summary-article-header)))) bind to a key.

*  sorting by score is wrong when using sparse threads.

*  a command to fetch an arbitrary article - without having to be in
 the summary buffer.

*  a new nncvs backend.  Each group would show an article, using
 version branches as threading, checkin date as the date, etc.

* A Date scoring type that will match if the article is less than a certain
 number of days old. With - < > = (etc) that take floating point numbers and
 match on the age of the article.

*  use the summary toolbar in the article buffer.

*  a command to fetch all articles that are less than X days old.

*  in pick mode, `q' should save the list of selected articles in the
 group info.  The next time the group is selected, these articles
 will automatically get the process mark.

*  Isn't it possible to (also?) allow M-^ to automatically try the
 default server if it fails on the current server?  (controlled by a
 user variable, (nil, t, 'ask)).

 [Done by `gnus-refer-article-method'?]

*  a new variable to control which selection commands should be
 unselecting.  `first', `best', `next', `prev', `next-unread',
 `prev-unread' are candidates.

*  `x' should retain any sortings that have been performed.

*  allow the user to specify the precedence of the secondary marks.
 Also allow them to be displayed separately.

*  gnus-summary-save-in-pipe should concatenate the results from the
 processes when doing a process marked pipe.

*  a new match type, like Followup, but which adds Thread matches on
 all articles that match a certain From header.

*  a function that can be read from kill-emacs-query-functions to
 offer saving living summary buffers.

*  a function for selecting a particular group which will contain
 the articles listed in a list of article numbers/id's.

*       (add-hook 'gnus-exit-query-functions
      '(lambda ()
	 (if (and (file-exists-p nnmail-spool-file)
		  (> (nnheader-file-size nnmail-spool-file) 0))
	     (yes-or-no-p "New mail has arrived.  Quit Gnus anyways? ")
	     (y-or-n-p "Are you sure you want to quit Gnus? "))))

*  gnus-article-hide-pgp Selv ville jeg nok ha valgt ,Ae(B slette den
 dersom teksten matcher
      "\\(This\s+\\)?[^ ]+ has been automatically signed by"
 og det er maks hundre tegn mellom match-end og ---linja.  Men -det-
 er min type heuristikk og langt fra alles.

*  `gnus-subscribe-sorted' - insert new groups where they would have
 been sorted to if `gnus-group-sort-function' were run.

*  gnus-(group,summary)-highlight should respect any `face' text
 props set on the lines.

*  nndraft-request-group should tally auto-save files.

*  implement nntp-retry-on-break and nntp-command-timeout.

*  gnus-article-highlight-limit that says when not to highlight
 (long) articles.

* Interrupting the agent fetching of articles should save articles.
 Have the Agent write out articles, one by one, as it retrieves
 them, to avoid having to re-fetch them all if Emacs should crash
 while fetching.

*  command to open a digest group, and copy all the articles there
 to the current group.

*  handle 480/381 authinfo requests separately.

*  command to display all dormant articles.

*  gnus-auto-select-next makeover - list of things it should do.

*  a score match type that adds scores matching on From if From has
 replied to something someone else has said.

* `T v' - make all process-marked articles the children of the
 current article.

* Switch from initial text to the new default text mechanism.

* How about making it possible to expire local articles?  Will it be
 possible to make various constraints on when an article can be
 expired, e.g. (read), (age > 14 days), or the more interesting
 (read & age > 14 days)?

* New limit command--limit to articles that have a certain string in
 the head or body.

* Allow breaking lengthy NNTP commands.

* gnus-article-highlight-limit, to disable highlighting in big
 articles.

* A command to send a mail to the admin-address group param.

* Allow Gnus Agent scoring to use normal score files.

* Rething the Agent active file thing.  `M-g' doesn't update the
 active file, for instance.

* With dummy roots, `^' and then selecing the first article in any
 other dummy thread will make Gnus highlight the dummy root instead
 of the first article.

* Propagate all group properties (marks, article numbers, etc) up to
 the topics for displaying.

* gnus-posting-styles doesn't work in drafts.

* gnus-summary-limit-include-cached is slow when there are many
 articles in the cache, since it regenerates big parts of the
 summary buffer for each article.

* Group parameters and summary commands for un/subscribing to mailing
 lists.

* Introduce nnmail-home-directory.

* gnus-fetch-group and friends should exit Gnus when the user exits
 the group.

* Crossposted articles should "inherit" the % or  mark from the other
 groups it has been crossposted to, or something.  (Agent.)

* If point is on a group that appears multiple times in topics, and
 you press `l', point will move to the first instance of the group.

* A spec for the group line format to display the number of
 agent-downloaded articles in the group.

* Some nntp servers never respond when posting, so there should be a
 timeout for all commands.

* When stading on a topic line and `t'-ing, point goes to the last
 line.  It should go somewhere else.

*  When `#F', do:

      Subject: Answer to your mails 01.01.1999-01.05.1999
       --text follows this line--
      Sorry I killfiled you...

      Under the subject "foo", you wrote on 01.01.1999:
      > bar
      Under the subject "foo1", you wrote on 01.01.1999:
      > bar 1

* Allow "orphan" scores in the Agent scoring.

  [done?]

*          - Edit article's summary line.
	  - End edit
	  - Sort lines in buffer by subject

	  --> the old subject line appears in Summary buffer, not the one that was
	  just changed to.

* Remove list identifiers from the subject in the summary when doing
 `^' and the like.

* nnweb should include the "get whole article" article when getting
 articles.

* Perhaps there should be a command to "attach" a buffer of comments
 to a message?  That is, `B WHATEVER', you're popped into a buffer,
 write something, end with `C-c C-c', and then the thing you've
 written gets to be the child of the message you're commenting.

* Handle external-body parts.

  [done for some access types]

* When renaming a group name, nnmail-split-history does not get the
 group name renamed.

* Allow mail splitting on bodies when using advanced mail splitting.

	(body "whatever.text")

* Solve the halting problem.
