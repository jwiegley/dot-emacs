The images in this directory were made with The Gimp and Inkscape.
They were created in my spare time as a donation to the Proof General
project.  The images here are released under the Creative Commons

The Inkscape-based search icon includes portions from Andrew
Fitzsimon's Etiquette search icon (under CC 2.0).
