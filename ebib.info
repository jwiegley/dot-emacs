Ebib Manual
***********

Ebib is a program with which you can manage BibTeX database files
without having to edit the raw `.bib' files. It runs in GNU/Emacs,
version 24.3 or higher. (Users of GNU/Emacs 23.1 and up can install Ebib
1.x, which is available in the pasture branch on Github or as a zip or
tar archive on Github's releases page.)

   It should be noted that Ebib is _not_ a minor or major mode for
editing BibTeX files. It is a program in itself, which just happens to
make use of Emacs as a working environment, in the same way that for
example Gnus is.

   The advantage of having a BibTeX database manager inside Emacs is
that X is no longer required, as Emacs can run on the console, and also
that some integration with Emacs' TeX and LaTeX modes becomes possible.
For example, you can push a BibTeX key from Ebib to a LaTeX buffer, or,
vice versa, when you're in a LaTeX buffer, you can consult your BibTeX
database and insert a key from it into the document. Another advantage
of Ebib is that it is completely controlled by key commands: no
stressful mouse movements are required, as with most other (usually
X-based) BibTeX database managers.

1.1 Package manager
===================

The easiest way to install Ebib is to use Emacs' package manager. Ebib
is available as a package from the Melpa package archive
(http://melpa.org/). If you add the Melpa archive to your
`package-archive' list, you can install Ebib from the package manager.
This will also install the Info file so you can access the Ebib manual
within Emacs.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Manual installation,  Next: Installing the info file,  Prev: Package manager,  Up: Installation

1.2 Manual installation
=======================

You can also install Ebib manually by copying the file `ebib.el' to
somewhere in your load path and add the following line to Emacs' init
file `~/.emacs':

(autoload 'ebib "ebib" "Ebib, a BibTeX database manager." t)

   On a default installation, the load path probably only contains
system directories. If you want to run `ebib.el' from somewhere else
(e.g., directly from the source directory), you can add this directory
to your load path:

(add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/ebib"))

   Note: if you do not know what your load path is set to, go to the
`*scratch*' buffer, type `load-path' on an empty line, put the cursor
right after it and type `C-j'. The value of `load-path' will then
appear in the buffer.

   Alternatively, you can load Ebib directly by putting the following in
`.emacs':

(load "/path/to/ebib")

   The difference between `load' and `autoload' is that the former
loads Ebib immediately and thus slows down Emacs' startup (a bit),
while the latter loads Ebib only when it is called (and thus slows down
Ebib's first time start up a bit).

   It is recommended to byte-compile the source, Ebib runs quite a lot
faster when it is byte-compiled. You can do this either within Emacs
with `M-x byte-compile-file' (recommended on OS X), or from your shell
by going into the directory where you put `ebib.el' and typing:

emacs -batch -f batch-byte-compile ebib.el

   This will create a file `ebib.elc', which Emacs will load instead of
`ebib.el'. Do this for every `.el' file in the source.

1.3 Installing the info file
============================

If you install Ebib through the package manager, the Info file is
installed automatically as well. However, if you install Ebib manually,
or run it from the source directory, this is not the case. If you want
the Info file to be accessible from within Emacs, you need to put it in
a directory where Emacs can find it. One way to do this is to put
`ebib.info' in one of the standard info directories. Make sure to run
`install-info ebib.info dir', so that Emacs knows about the new info
file.

   Alternatively, you can leave `ebib.info' in Ebib's source directory
and add that dir to `Info-additional-directory-list'. It contains a
suitable `dir' file, so there's no need to run `install-info'.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Starting Ebib,  Next: Upgrading from Ebib 1x,  Prev: Installing the info file,  Up: Installation

1.4 Starting Ebib
=================

Once Ebib has been installed and is loaded, you can start it with `M-x
ebib'. This command is also used to return to Ebib when you have put
the program in the background. You can bind this command to a key
sequence by putting something like the following in Emacs' init file:

(global-set-key "\C-ce" 'ebib)

   You can of course choose any key combination you like. (In Emacs, key
combinations of `C-c' `<letter>' are reserved for the user, which means
that no package may set them.)

   You can also call Ebib from an Eshell command line. This in itself is
entirely unspectacular (in Eshell, you can invoke any Emacs function),
but the nice thing is that you can then provide a filename to load. So,
provided a file `references.bib' exists in `~/Work/Papers/', the
following command:

~/Work/Papers $ ebib references.bib

   starts Ebib and loads the file `references.bib'.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Upgrading from Ebib 1x,  Prev: Starting Ebib,  Up: Installation

1.5 Upgrading from Ebib 1.x
===========================

If you upgrade from Ebib 1.x to the current version 2, there are a few
things you need to be aware of. First, Ebib 2 does not support Emacs
versions below 24.3. If you're on an older version of Emacs, either
upgrade Emacs, or do not upgrade Ebib. Ebib 1.x will continue to be
available in the `pasture' branch on Github or as a package on the
Github releases page, so if for some reason you do not want to upgrade,
you can continue to use this branch. Ebib 1.x will continue to be
supported with bug fixes and possibly the occasional (small) feature
addition, though no major changes will take place.

   If you do upgrade, it is important to note that a few customisation
options have changed. If you never made any customisations to Ebib, the
upgrade should not pose any problems. If you have, however, read on.

   The most important change is that the variable `ebib-entry-types'
(option "Entry Types") has been removed. Ebib now uses the entry type
definitions of the built-in `bibtex-mode', which means that if you wish
to customise the entry types, you should customise
`bibtex-BibTeX-entry-alist' or `bibtex-biblatex-entry-alist'.

   Secondly, a few user options have been renamed because their types
have changed. (Mainly from `symbol' to `string'). The name change means
that existing customisations are lost, but it also prevents Ebib from
throwing cryptic errors and refusing to run. If you customised any of
the following options, you should redo them after upgrading Ebib (and
preferably remove the old ones from your init file):

   * `ebib-default-entry': renamed to `ebib-default-entry-type'.

   * `ebib-additional-fields': renamed to `ebib-extra-fields'.

   * `ebib-standard-url-field': renamed to `ebib-url-field'.

   * `ebib-standard-file-field': renamed to `ebib-file-field'.

   * `ebib-standard-doi-field': renamed to `ebib-doi-field'.

   * `ebib-biblatex-inheritance': renamed to
     `ebib-biblatex-inheritances' (note the `s').

   Note that even if you customised `ebib-biblatex-inheritance', there
is most likely no need to customise its replacement
`ebib-biblatex-inheritances', because the latter is set up with the
default inheritance rules that BibLaTeX defines.

   Another thing to note is that four user options have a new default
value. First, the default location of the rc file has moved to
`~/.emacs.d/ebibrc', in line with the recommendation to keep all
Emacs-related files in `~/.emacs.d'. If you kept an `.ebibrc' file in
your home directory, move it to `~/.emacs.d'. Second, a
`\documentclass' definition has been added to the user options "Latex
Preamble" (`ebib-latex-preamble') and "Print Preamble"
(`ebib-print-preamble'). If you customised one of these, you should add
a document class specification, otherwise the LaTeX file won't compile.
Third, the option `ebib-save-xrefs-first' now defaults to `t'.

   Lastly, if you use BibLaTeX, make sure to read the section on using
Ebib with BibLaTeX files.

2 Getting Started
*****************

A BibTeX database is somewhat of a free-form database. A BibTeX entry
consists of a set of field-value pairs. Furthermore, each entry is known
by a unique key. The way that Ebib navigates this database is by having
two windows, one that contains a list of all the entry keys in the
database, and one that contains the fields and values of the currently
highlighted entry.

   When Ebib is started, the current windows in Emacs are hidden and the
Emacs frame is divided into two windows. The top one contains a buffer
that is called the _index buffer_, while the lower window contains the
_entry buffer_. When a database is loaded, the index buffer holds a
list of all the keys in the database. You can move through these keys
with the cursor keys. In the entry buffer, the fields of the currently
highlighted entry are shown, with their values.

   This manual first describes Ebib's basic functionality, so that you
can get startet with it. At times, reference will be made to later
sections, where more specific functions are described.

   Ebib has a menu through which most functions can be accessed.
(Especially some of the lesser used functions can only be accessed
through the menu, unless you assign key shortcuts to them, of course.)

   You can start Ebib with the command `M-x ebib'. Entering this
command hides all the windows in the current Emacs frame and replaces
them with two windows: the top one contains the index buffer, the bottom
one, taking up the larger part of the screen, contains the entry buffer.
The index buffer is named `none', to indicate that no database has been
loaded. If you open a database, or start a new one, the index buffer
will carry its name.

   You can quit Ebib by typing `q'. You will be asked for confirmation,
and you will receive a warning if you happen to have an unsaved
database. You can also leave Ebib with the command `z'.  However,
unlike `q', which completely quits Ebib, `z' only lowers it, so that it
remains active in the background. The `.bib' files that you have opened
remain loaded, and you can return to them by typing `M-x ebib' again.

File: ebib.info,  Node: Opening a bib File,  Next: Preloading bib Files,  Up: Getting Started

2.1 Opening a `.bib' File
=========================

Loading a `.bib' file into Ebib is done with the command `o'.  Ebib
reads the file that you specify, and reports how many entries it found,
how many `@string' definitions it found, and whether a `@preamble' was
found. Note that when Ebib reads a `.bib' file, it only reads entry
types (e.g. `book, article, phdthesis' etc.) that it knows about.
Therefore, you should make sure that all the entry types and fields
that your databases use are defined. Ebib uses the entry type
definitions of `bibtex.el', which is fairly complete, but if you use
non-standard entry types, make sure they have been defined or customise
`bibtex-bibtex-entry-alist' or `bibtex-biblatex-entry-alist', depending
on which of the two you use.

   Every time Ebib reads a `.bib' file, it produces a few log messages.
These are written into a special buffer `*Ebib-log*'. If Ebib
encounters entry types in the `.bib' file that it doesn't know, a
warning will be logged. If Ebib finds something that it cannot parse,
it will log an error. If warnings and/or errors occurred during
loading, Ebib will issue a message when it finishes loading the `.bib'
and direct you to the log buffer.

   If Ebib finds entry types in a `.bib' file that are not defined,
those entries will still be loaded, but their entry type is displayed
using Emacs' `error' face. The most likely case in which this will
happen is when you load a BibLaTeX file without letting Ebib know the
file is BibLaTeX-specific. By default, Ebib assumes that a `.bib' file
it loads is a BibTeX file. If you intend to use BibLaTeX files, make
sure to read the section on BibLateX ([Using
BibLaTeX][#using-biblatex]).

2.2 Preloading `.bib' Files
===========================

Chances are that you will be doing most of your work with one or a few
`.bib' files, and you may find yourself opening the same file or files
every time you start Ebib. If so, you can tell Ebib to always load
specific `.bib' files on startup. To do this, specify the files in
Ebib's customisation buffer, under the option "Preload Bib Files".

   By default, `.bib' files are searched for in your home directory.
Since this is most likely not where you keep the files, you need to
specify either the file's full path or a relative path starting from
your home directory. Alternatively, you can customise the option "Bib
Search Dirs" to specify one or more directories in which Ebib should
search the `.bib' files.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Navigating a bib File,  Next: Starting a New bib File,  Prev: Preloading bib Files,  Up: Getting Started

2.3 Navigating a `.bib' File
============================

Once you've opened a `.bib' file, the keys of all the entries in the
file are shown in alphabetical order in the index buffer in the top
Ebib window. (In fact, it is possible to show more than just the entry
key in this buffer. See the option "Index Display Fields" on how to
accomplish this.) The first entry is highlighted, meaning it is the
current entry. The fields it holds and their values are shown in the
entry buffer in the bottom Ebib window. The first field is the type
field, which tells you what kind of entry you're dealing with (i.e.
`book', `article', etc.).

   Below the type field, Ebib displays (up to) four sets of fields. The
first set are the so-called required fields, the fields that Bib(La)TeX
requires to be filled. The second group are the optional fields, which
do not have to be filled but which Bib(La)TeX will normally add to the
bibliography if they do have a value. The third group are the so-called
extra fields. These fields are usually ignored by Bib(La)TeX (note that
Bib(La)TeX normally ignores _all_ fields it does not know), although
there are bibliography styles that treat some of these fields as
optional rather than as extra. Extra fields are defined in the user
option "Extra Fields". Lastly, the fourth set of fields shown in the
entry buffer are fields that exist in the entry but are not defined as
part of the entry type nor as extra fields.

   The first two groups of fields are different for each entry type,
while the third group are common to all entry types. You can use the
extra fields, for example, to add personal comments to the works in your
database. Ebib by default defines the following extra fields:
`crossref', `url' (BibTeX only), `annote' (`annotation' for BibLaTeX),
`abstract', `keywords', `file', `timestamp', and `doi' (BibTeX only).
`url' and `doi' are defined only for BibTeX, since BibLaTeX defines them
as optional fields for most entry types. If these are not sufficient for
you, you can customise the option "Extra Fields".

   To move around in the index buffer, you can use the `up' and `down'
cursor keys, `C-p' and `C-n', or for those more used to mutt's key
bindings, `k' and `j'. Furthermore, `Space' and `PgDn' move a screenful
of entries down, while `b' and `PgUp' move in the other direction.
Lastly, `g' and `Home' move to the first entry, while `G' and `End'
move to the last one.

   Ebib is not restricted to opening just one `.bib' file at a time.
You can open more files by just typing `o' again and entering the
filename. Ebib numbers the databases: the number of each database is
shown in the mode line of the index buffer, directly before the database
name. The keys 1-9 provide a quick way of jumping from one database to
another. Note that the numbering is dynamic: if you have three databases
opened and then close the second, database 3 becomes database 2.

   With the `left' and `right' cursor keys, you can move to the
previous or next database. These keys wrap, so if you hit the `left'
cursor key while the first database is active, you move to the last
database. If you are done with a database and want to close it, type
`c'. This closes the current database. It does not leave Ebib, and all
other databases you have open will remain so.

2.4 Starting a New `.bib' File
==============================

If you want to start a new `.bib' file from scratch, you cannot just go
and enter entries. You first have to give the database a name.  So, to
start a new database, type `o' first, and give the new file a name.
Once you have done this, you can start adding entries to the database.

3 Editing the Database
**********************

Of course, being able to open and view `.bib' files is only half the
fun. One needs to be able to edit the files as well. Ebib's essential
editing facilities are discussed here.

* Menu:

* Adding and Deleting Entries::
* Editing Fields Values::
* Editing Multiline Values::
* Undefined Fields::
* Hidden Fields::
* Copy Cut Paste Yank and Delete::


File: ebib.info,  Node: Adding and Deleting Entries,  Next: Editing Fields Values,  Up: Editing the Database

3.1 Adding and Deleting Entries
===============================

To add an entry to a database, you type `a'. When you do this, Ebib
first asks you for an entry key, as every entry must be identified by a
unique key. Just type a name for the new entry (say `Jones1998').
Since the entry key must be unique, Ebib will complain if you enter a
key that already exists.

   You can also let Ebib automatically generate entry keys: if you set
the customisation option "Autogenerate Keys", Ebib does not ask you for
a key when you add a new entry. Instead, it creates a temporary key (of
the form `<new-entry>'). When you have finished entering the field
values for the new entry, Ebib automatically replaces the temporary key
with a key that is based on the contents of the `author' (or `editor'),
`year' and `title' fields. (It uses the function
`bibtex-generate-autokey' for this; see that function's documentation
string for customisation options.)

   Note that if you should later decide that you want to change the key
of an entry, you can do so with the command `E'. So if you have an
entry with the key `Jones1998' and you want to add another entry by
Jones from 1998, you can call the new one `Jones1998b' and rename the
existing one to `Jones1998a'. Similarly, it is possible to let Ebib
recreate an autogenerated key by pressing `!'.

   Deleting an entry is done with `d'. Be careful with this: you will
be asked for confirmation, but once you've confirmed, the entry is gone,
and it is not possible to bring it back. There is no undo in Ebib. (If
you haven't saved the database yet, it is still possible to retrieve the
deleted entry from the `.bib' file, and otherwise it may still be in
the backup file that Ebib creates; *note Saving a Database:
#saving-a-database.)


File: ebib.info,  Node: Editing Fields Values,  Next: Editing Multiline Values,  Prev: Adding and Deleting Entries,  Up: Editing the Database

3.2 Editing Fields Values
=========================

Editing the field values for an entry is done in the lower of the two
Ebib buffers, the so-called entry buffer. You can move focus to the
entry buffer and start editing field values by typing the command `e'
in the index buffer.

   You can move between fields with the same keys that you use to move
between entries in the index buffer: the cursor keys `up' and `down',
`C-p' and `C-n', or `j' and `k'.  `Space' and `PgDn' move to the next
set of fields, while `PgUp' and `b' move to the previous set of fields.
`g' and `G', and `Home' and `End' also work as expected.

   Editing a field value can be done with `e'. (In fact, in the entry
buffer, `RET' is equivalent to `e'.) For most fields, Ebib simply asks
you for a string value in the minibuffer. (Here, `RET' confirms the
edit, while `C-g' cancels it.) Although BibTeX requires that field
values be surrounded by braces {} (or double quotes "", but Ebib does
not use those, even though it can of course handle them when they are
used in an existing `.bib' file) you do not need to type these. Ebib
adds them when it saves the `.bib' file.

   Some fields, however, are handled in a special way. The first of
these is the `type' field: if you edit this field, you must enter one of
the predefined entry types. Ebib won't allow you to enter anything else.
You can use TAB completion in this case. Similarly, if you edit the
`crossref' field, Ebib requires that you fill in a key from the
database. Here, too, you can use TAB completion. The fields `keywords'
and `file' are also treated differently, see *note Managing keywords:
#managing-keywords. and *note Viewing Files: #viewing-files,
respectively.

   Note that if you're adding a new entry, Ebib automatically puts you
in the entry buffer after you've typed the entry key: you don't have to
type `e' to move to the entry buffer. When creating a new entry, it is
best to set the `type' field first, because the `type' field determines
which other fields are available for an entry. After editing a field,
Ebib (usually) puts you on the next field. This is convenient if you're
creating a new entry and need to fill out several fields in a row.

   If you're done editing the fields of the entry, type `q' to move
focus back to the index buffer. (Note: keys may have different functions
in the index buffer and the entry buffer. `q' is a typical example: in
the entry buffer, it quits editing the entry and moves focus back to
the index buffer. In the index buffer, however, `q' quits Ebib.)


File: ebib.info,  Node: Editing Multiline Values,  Next: Undefined Fields,  Prev: Editing Fields Values,  Up: Editing the Database

3.3 Editing Multiline Values
============================

Apart from the `type', `keywords', `file' and `crossref' fields, there
is another field that Ebib handles in a special way when you edit its
value. This is the `annote' field (`annotation' in BibLaTeX). Most
field values normally consist of a single line of text. However,
because the `annote' field is meant for creating annotated
bibliographies, it would not be very useful if you could only write one
line of text in this field. Therefore, when you edit the `annote'
field, Ebib puts you in the so-called _multiline edit buffer_. This is
essentially a text mode buffer that allows you to enter as much text as
you like. To store the text and leave the multiline edit buffer, type
`C-c | q'.

   If you want to leave the multiline edit buffer without saving the
text you have just typed, type `C-c | c'. This command cancels the edit
and leaves the multiline edit buffer. The text that is stored in the
field you were editing is not altered.

   Multiline values are not restricted to the `annote' field. Any field
(except the `type' and `crossref' fields) can in fact hold a multiline
value. To give a field a multiline value, use `m' instead of `e'. You
will again be put in the multiline edit buffer, where you can edit the
value. Note that you can use `m' even if a field already has a single
line value. Ebib will just make that the first line in the multiline
edit buffer.

   When a field has a multiline value, only the first line is shown in
the entry buffer, for space reasons. To indicate that the value is
multiline, a plus sign `+' is placed in front of the value. If you want
to see the whole contents of a multiline field, you can use `v': this
will display the contents of the current field in a `*Help*' buffer.
This buffer can be dismissed again with `q'.  This is quicker than
entering the multiline edit buffer just to read the contents of a field
and it has the advantage that the other fields stay visible.

   By the way, the `e' key is smart about the way an entry must be
edited. If you press `e' on a field that already has a multiline value,
regardless of the fact whether it is the `annote' field or not, Ebib
puts you in the multiline edit buffer. Therefore, you need `m' only if
you want to give a field a multiline value when it doesn't have one yet.

   For more details on working with the multiline edit buffer, see
*note The Multiline Edit Buffer: #the-multiline-edit-buffer.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Undefined Fields,  Next: Hidden Fields,  Prev: Editing Multiline Values,  Up: Editing the Database

3.4 Undefined Fields
====================

BibTeX ignores fields that it does not know, which is a property that
can be exploited to add any kind of information to a BibTeX entry. Ebib
accommodates this by allowing fields with any name, not just the ones
that are predefined. Such undefined fields are displayed last in the
entry buffer, following the extra fields.

   It is even possible to add such fields to an entry by pressing `a'
in the entry buffer. This asks for a field name and then a value. If you
make heavy use of this option, it may be better to define the relevant
fields through the user option "Extra Fields", but undefined fields may
be useful when reading or importing BibTeX entries from a different
source that contain non-standard fields.

   Note that if you delete the contents of an undefined field, the field
itself remains in the database until you quit Ebib (or close the
database). It will not be saved, however, so the next time you load the
`.bib' file, the field is gone.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Hidden Fields,  Next: Copy Cut Paste Yank and Delete,  Prev: Undefined Fields,  Up: Editing the Database

3.5 Hidden Fields
=================

BibLaTeX defines a large number of fields, many of which are optional
for most entry types. Displaying all these fields in the entry buffer
would not be very practical, because you are most likely interested in
only a few of them. For this reason, Ebib defines a (fairly large)
number of fields as 'hidden', meaning that they are not shown in the
entry buffer. You can make these fields visible with the key `H' in the
index buffer. Which fields are treated as hidden is controlled by the
option "Hidden Fields", which can be customised.

   Most of the fields defined as hidden are BibLaTeX-specific, because
BibTeX recognises a much smaller number of fields and there isn't much
of a need to hide the lesser used ones. However, the functionality is
available: if you wish to use it, just add the relevant fields to the
option "Hidden Fields".


File: ebib.info,  Node: Copy Cut Paste Yank and Delete,  Prev: Hidden Fields,  Up: Editing the Database

3.6 Copy, Cut, Paste (Yank), and Delete
=======================================

A few more commands are available when you're in the entry buffer
editing field values. The commands `c', `x' and `y' implement copy,
kill and yank: `c' copies the contents of the current field to the kill
ring, `x' kills the contents of the current field to the kill ring, and
`y' yanks (pastes) the most recently killed text in the kill ring. You
can type `y' repeatedly to get the same effect you get in Emacs when
you type `M-y' after an initial `C-y'.

   Lastly, there is the command `d', which deletes the contents of the
current field without storing the text in the kill ring. (It asks for
confirmation, though, just to make sure.)

   Note that `y' only works when the current field does not have a
value yet. This is to prevent you from accidentally overwriting a field
value. If you do want to yank text into a field that already has a
value, simply hit `d' first to delete the text.

4 Saving a Database
*******************

When you have undertaken any kind of editing action on a database, it is
marked as modified, which is indicated in the mode line for the index
buffer. A modified database can be saved by typing `s'. This saves the
database to the file it was loaded from without asking for
confirmation. (It is similar to `C-x C-s' in Emacs.) If you're saving a
file for the first time after loading it, Ebib creates a backup file.
(Ebib honours `backup-directory-alist' when saving backups.  Note that
you can also disable backups altogether with the option "Create
Backups".)

   If you have multiple databases open, have made changes in more than
one of them, and want to save all of them without going through each
yourself, you can save all databases at once through the menu. You can
also save the database to another name, similar to `C-x C-w' in Emacs:
the new `.bib' file becomes associated with the database.  The command
for this is `w'.

5 Using BibLaTeX
****************

Compared to BibTeX, BibLaTeX has a greatly expanded number of fields, a
somewhat different set of entry types and a much more complex system of
field value inheritances. Ebib can handle both kinds of files, provided
it is set up for the right “dialect”.

* Setting the BibTeX Dialect::
* Alias Types and Fields::


File: ebib.info,  Node: Setting the BibTeX Dialect,  Next: Alias Types and Fields,  Up: Using BibLaTeX

5.1 Setting the BibTeX Dialect
==============================

BibLaTeX files use the same `.bib' suffix that BibTeX files use.
Whether a file is interpreted as a BibTeX or a BibLaTeX is determined by
the user option “Bibtex Dialect” (i.e., the variable
`ebib-bibtex-dialect'). Possible values for this option are `BibTeX'
and `biblatex'. (These values are taken from the variable
`bibtex-dialect-list'.) The default value of this option is `BibTeX'.
If you wish to read or create BibLaTeX files in Ebib, you'll need to
change the value of `ebib-bibtex-dialect'.

   The dialect specified determines which entry types Ebib recognises
and which fields it expects. Reading a file with the wrong dialect
setting will most likely result in a series of “Illegal entry type”
errors.  Note, however, that these entries will still be loaded and
displayed, but they will be highlighted with Emacs' `error' face.
Fields that are not defined for the current dialect are displayed as
undefined fields (i.e., below all other fields in the entry buffer).

   The option “Bibtex Dialect” sets the default dialect. It is possible
to set the dialect for individual files as well. To do this, load the
file and then set the dialect through the menu option «Ebib | BibTeX
Dialect» or with the command `M-x ebib-set-dialect'. You only need to do
this once for a file, because the setting is saved in the `.bib' file
in the local variable block. (If no local variable block exists, one is
created.) The setting is actually saved as a file-local value for the
variable `bibtex-dialect', which means that if you should open the file
directly in `bibtex-mode', Emacs will apply the dialect setting as
well. (Note, by the way, that Ebib's option to set the BibTeX Dialect
is different from the one provided by `bibtex-mode'.  Specifically, the
former uses the variable `ebib-bibtex-dialect', while the latter uses
`bibtex-dialect'.)

   The mode line of the index buffer shows the dialect that Ebib assumes
for the current database. Note that this does not necessarily mean that
the dialect is set in the `.bib' file: if the file does not have a
dialect setting, the mode line shows the default setting.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Alias Types and Fields,  Prev: Setting the BibTeX Dialect,  Up: Using BibLaTeX

5.2 Alias Types and Fields
==========================

The set of entry types defined by BibLaTeX differs from the set used by
BibTeX. Mostly, BibLaTeX adds new entry types, but there are a few
BibTeX entry types that have been dropped. For legacy reasons, BibLaTeX
still recognises these entry types, but it treats them as aliases for
some of its own types. The relevant entry types are `@conference'
(treated as an alias for `@inproceedings'), `@electronic' (alias for
`@online'), `@mastersthesis' (alias for `@thesis' with the `type' field
set to 'Master's thesis'), `@phdthesis' (alias for `@thesis' with the
`type' field set to 'PhD thesis'), `@techreport' (alias for `@report'
with the `type' field set to 'technical report') and `@www' (alias for
`@online'). If an entry has such an alias as entry type, Ebib displays
the entry type that BibLaTeX treats it as in the entry buffer. (For
example, the entry type alias `phdthesis' is shown as `phdthesis [==>
Thesis]'.)

   Similarly, a number of fields are deprecated but still accepted as
aliases. These are `address' (alias for `location'), `annote' (alias
for `annotation'), `archiveprefix' (for `eprinttype'), `journal' (for
`journaltitle'), `key' (for `sortkey'), `pdf' (for `file'),
`primaryclass' (for `eprintclass'), and `school' (for `institution').
These aliases are also indicated in the entry buffer, albeit in a
slightly different way. For example, if an entry has a `journal' field,
its value is shown as the value of the `journaltitle' field; a tag
`[<== journal]' is placed after the field value, indicating that the
value is actually contained in the journal field. The `journal' field
itself is shown as an undefined field (i.e., after all other fields).
That is, in such cases, the value is shown twice: once as the
`journaltitle' field (among the obligatory fields), and once as the
`journal' field. This is done so that you can easily copy the value of
the `journal' field to the `journaltitle' field, if you wish to bring
your entries into line with BibLaTeX's conventions.

* Menu:

* Simple Searches::
* Filters::


File: ebib.info,  Node: Simple Searches,  Next: Filters,  Up: Searching

6.1 Simple Searches
===================

Ebib provides several search methods. The simplest method is to type
`/', which searches for a string (more precisely, a regular expression)
starting from the current entry (i.e., _not_ from the first entry) and
will display the entry with the first occurrence of the search string
that it finds. All the occurrences of the search string in that entry
are highlighted.

   Ebib searches all the fields of each entry. It is not possible with
`/' to specify the fields to search. Note that if the search term is
found in a field with a multiline value, Ebib will highlight the `+'
sign that it displays in front of the field value. Keep an eye out for
this when doing a search, because Ebib only shows the first line of
multiline values, and if the search term appears in another line, the
highlighted `+' is the only indication that the search term was found.
(Well, that and the fact that Ebib does _not_ say "Search string not
found", of course...)

   A search term may of course appear more than once in the database. To
search for the next occurrence, type `n'. This will continue searching
for the search string in the rest of the database. Again, the first
entry found to contain the search string is displayed. Note that `n'
does not wrap: if the end of the database is reached, Ebib stops
searching. To continue searching from the top, hit `g' and then `n'.

   Note, by the way, that if you are in the index buffer, the normal
Emacs incremental searches, `C-s' and `C-r', can be used to search
entry keys. Once you've found the key you're searching, you must hit
`RET' to quit the search and again `RET' to make the entry you found
active: Ebib does not update the entry buffer during incremental
search. If you make frequent use of this option, you may want to make
the cursor visible in the Ebib buffers. Unset the customisation option
"Hide Cursor" to do so.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Filters,  Prev: Simple Searches,  Up: Searching

6.2 Filters
===========

Ebib also has a much more sophisticated search mechanism that makes use
of _filters_. A filter is basically a search expression that selects
entries from the current database. When you apply a filter to a
database, only the entries that match are shown. With filters, you can,
for example, select all entries from a database that contain the string
"Jones" in their `author' field. A filter can be as complex as you
want: you can select all entries that do _not_ contain "Jones" in the
`author' field, or all entries that contain "Jones" in either the
`author' or the `editor' field, or all entries that contain "Jones" in
the `author' field, and "symbiotic hibernation" in the `keyword' field,
etc. Basically, the filter can consist of an arbitary number of search
criteria combined with the logical operators `and, or' and `not'.

* Complex Filters::
* Storing and Saving Filters::
* Properties of Filtered Databases::


File: ebib.info,  Node: Simple Selection,  Next: Complex Filters,  Up: Filters

6.2.1 Simple Selection
----------------------

Creating a filter is simple: press `&', and Ebib will ask you for a
field to select on, and for a regular expression to select with. So if
you want to select all entries that contain "Jones" in the `author'
field, you press `&' and type `author' as the field and `Jones' as the
regexp to filter on. Ebib then runs this filter on the database, and
only shows those entries that match the filter. To indicate that a
filter is active, the active filter is displayed in the mode line of
index buffer. (The filter can be displayed in Lisp form, if you prefer:
customise "Filters Display As Lisp" to do so.)

   If you don't want to filter on one specific field but rather want to
select all entries that match a certain regexp in any field, you can
type `any' as the field to filter on. So specifying `any' as the field
and `Jones' as the regexp will give you all entries that have a field
that contains "Jones" in them.

   Note that you can also select items based on their entry type. In
order to do that, you need to specify `=type=' as the field to search,
which is the field name in which Ebib stores the entry type internally.
(There is also a "normal" field called `type', hence the equal signs.)
If you search the `=type=' field, only exact matches are returned, so
if you search for `book', only the entries that are of type `book' are
returned, not those of type `inbook'. You can use TAB completion in
this case, by the way.

   If you specify the `keywords' field, the keywords associated with
your database are available for TAB completion as well. Though you can
enter any search term, of course.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Complex Filters,  Next: Storing and Saving Filters,  Prev: Simple Selection,  Up: Filters

6.2.2 Complex Filters
---------------------

Once you have a filter on your database, you can refine or extend it.
For example, suppose you have a filter selecting all entries with
"Jones" in the `author' field and want to add all entries that have
"Jones" in the editor field to your selection. In this case you need to
do a logical `or' operation: you want to select an entry if it contains
"Jones" in the `author' field (which you already did) _or_ if it
contains "Jones" in the `editor' field.

   A short sidenote: the first impulse in a case like this might be to
use `and' instead of `or': after all, you want to select all entries
that contain "Jones" in the `author' field _and_ all entries that
contain "Jones" in the `editor' field. However, the filter that you
build up is used to test each entry _individually_ whether it meets the
selection criterion. An entry meets the criterion if it contains
"Jones" in the `author' field _or_ if it contains "Jones" in the
`editor' field. Therefore, `or' is the required operator in this case.
If you would use `and', you would only get those entries that contain
"Jones" in both the `author' _and_ `editor' fields.

   To perform a logical `or' operation, press the key `|'. As before,
you will be asked which field you want to filter on, and which regexp
you want to filter with. Ebib will then update the index buffer.

   It is also possible to perform a logical `and' on the filter. Use
this if you want to select those entries that contain "Jones" in the
`author' field and e.g. "symbiotic hibernation" in the `keyword' field.
A logical `and' operation is done with the key `&'. (Note: this is the
same key that is used to create the filter. In fact, you can create a
filter with `|' as well: when used in an unfiltered database, `&' and
`|' are equivalent.  They are only different when a filter is already
active.)

   Both the `&' and `|' commands can be used with the negative prefix
argument `M--' (or `C-u -', which is identical). In this case, the
search criterion is negated. That is, the negative prefix argument
performs a logical `not' operation on the search criterion. For
example, if you want to select all entries from a database that do
_not_ contain "Jones" in the `author' field, you can do this by typing
`M-- &' and then filling out the relevant field and regexp.

   There is another way of performing a logical `not' operation, which
is only available when a filter is active: by pressing the key `~', you
invert the current filter. That is, if you have a filtered database
with all the entries containing "Jones" in the `author' or in the
`editor' field, and you press `~', the selection is inverted, and now
contains all entries that do _not_ have "Jones" in the `author' or
`editor' field.

   Although `~' and the negative prefix argument to `&' or `|' both
perform logical `not' operations, they are _not_ equivalent: `~'
negates the entire filter built up so far, while the negative prefix
argument only negates the single selection criterion you enter with it.

   When a filter is active, the filter itself is displayed at the top of
the index buffer. If the index window is too small to display the entire
filter (which can easily happen if Ebib is set to split the frame
vertically rather than horizontally), you can press `F v' (uppercase
`F', small `v'), which will display the filter in the minibuffer.

   To cancel the filter and return to the normal view of the database,
press `F c'. For convenience, this action is also available with `c',
which normally closes a database. If a filter is active, however, it
simply cancels the filter. (If you find this behaviour confusing, you
can rebind the `c' key to the function `ebib-close-database'. See *note
Modifying Key Bindings: #modifying-key-bindings. for details.)


File: ebib.info,  Node: Storing and Saving Filters,  Next: Properties of Filtered Databases,  Prev: Complex Filters,  Up: Filters

6.2.3 Storing and Saving Filters
--------------------------------

When you cancel a filter, it is automatically stored so that it can be
reapplied later. To reapply a filter, type `F L'. This will reapply the
last used filter regardless of which database you're in. That is, you
can use this to search more than one database without having to type
the filter over and over.

   However, Ebib only stores one filter this way. If you want to store
more filters, you have to name them. You can store the currently active
filter or the last used filter with `F s'. Ebib will ask you for a name
for the filter in order to identify it later. By default, filter names
are case-insensitive, but if you prefer to use case-sensitive filter
names, you can unset the option "Filters Ignore Case". When Ebib is
closed, all stored filters are saved to a file and they're
automatically reloaded when you open Ebib again. Stored filters are not
associated with a particular database: once a filter is stored, it is
available to all databases.

   You can apply a stored filter with `F a'. This will ask for the name
of a filter and apply it to the current database. You can extend the
filter in the normal way, though the changes will not be stored
automatically. To store it, type `F s' again. You can store the
extended filter under the old name, in which case Ebib will ask you for
confirmation, or under a new name, which will store it as a new filter,
keeping the old one.

   The file that Ebib uses to store filters is
`~/.emacs.d/ebib-filters', although that can of course be customised
(see the option "Filters Default File"). As mentioned, stored filters
are saved automatically when Ebib closes, but you can also save them
manually with `F S'. Note that if there are no stored filters when Ebib
is closed (or when you press `F S'), the file is deleted.

   You can also save your filters to a different file with `F w'. Such
a filter file can be reloaded later with `F l'. If you load filters
from a file while you still have stored filters, you are asked if you
want to replace them completely or if you want to add the new filters to
the existing ones. In the latter case, however, filters whose name
conflict with existing filters are not loaded. (Ebib will log a message
about this when this happens.)

   To see what filters are currently stored, use `F V'. If you want to
rename a filter, you can do so with `F R'.

   Note that cancelling a filter with `F c' does not delete it from the
list of stored filters, it will remain available for later application.
If you want to delete a filter from the list of stored filters, use `F
d'. You can also delete all stored filters with `F D'. These deletion
commands do not ask for confirmation, but if you delete any filters by
accident, you can reload them from `~/.emacs.d/ebib-filters' with `F l'.

6.2.4 Properties of Filtered Databases
--------------------------------------

When a filter is active, there are a few things that are not possible or
function differently. First, it is not possible to add or delete
entries, either interactively or by merging or exporting. Exporting from
a filtered database or saving a filtered database is also disabled. (The
reasons for these limitations are mainly historic and they may be lifted
in future version). Editing existing entries is possible, however. Note
that if the entry doesn't match the filter anymore after the edit, it
doesn't disappear from view. In order to reapply the filter, press `F
r'.

   It is also possible to mark entries. Marked entries stay marked when
you cancel the filter, so in order to do something with all the entries
matching a filter, you can mark them all in the filter view with `M',
then cancel the filter and perform an action on them.

   Although a filtered database cannot be saved, it is possible to write
the filtered entries to a file. To do so, use `F W'. This command also
writes all the `@string' definitions and the `@preamble', so you end up
with a complete `.bib' file. (Note that this is in fact the same
command as the menu option "Save Database As". This command behaves
differently depending on whether a filter is active. If there is, only
the filtered entries are written to the new file and the original
database remains open. If no filter is active, all the entries are
written and the database in Ebib is renamed.)

   One final note: of all the filter-related commands, `~', `F c', `F
r', `F s' and `F v' and of course the special function of `F w' are
only available when a filter is active. The other commands operate on
the stored filters and can be used when no filter is active.

7 Consulting BibTeX Databases outside Ebib
******************************************

Having a BibTeX database manager running inside Emacs has an additional
advantage: it makes it easy to consult your BibTeX databases from a text
buffer. By default, this functionality is set up for LaTeX, for Orgmode
(http://orgmode.org) and for Pandoc (http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)
Markdown.

   In any (text mode) buffer, you can call the command
`ebib-insert-bibtex-key' to insert a citation. When you invoke this
command, Emacs prompts you for a key from the database(s) associated
with the current buffer, a citation command and any optional argument(s)
the command allows. You can use TAB completion to enter a citation key,
and after hitting `RET', Emacs puts a citation at the cursor position
in the current buffer with the key you selected. This citation includes
the additional markup for the text mode in question. That is, if you
call `ebib-insert-bibtex-key' from a LaTeX buffer, Ebib inserts
`\<cite>{<key>}' into your buffer, substituting the citation command
you select for `<cite>' and the key for `<key>'.

   You can also do it the other way around: if you're in the index
buffer in Ebib, you can push an entry to a text buffer. To do this, use
the command `p'. Ebib will ask you for a buffer to push the entry to
(which defaults to the buffer you started Ebib from, or the buffer you
previously pushed an entry to), a citation command and also any optional
arguments, and then inserts a citation at the current cursor position in
the buffer you've supplied.

   The citation command that `ebib-insert-bibtex-key' and the command
key `p' ask for have to be defined before you can use them. How to do
this is explained below, *note Defining Citation Commands:
#defining-citation-commands. For LaTeX, only the `\cite' command is set
up by default, so you may want to add some commands. In Orgmode files,
Ebib inserts a link of the form `[[ebib:Jones1992][Jones (1992)]]'.
(Actually, you'll need to provide the `Jones (1992)' yourself, when
Ebib asks for a description.) If you use this, you should add the
following line to your init file:

(org-add-link-type "ebib" 'ebib-open-org-link)

   This will allow Orgmode to recognise Ebib links and allow you to
jump to the BibTeX entry in Ebib using `C-c C-o' (`org-open-at-point',
the normal Orgmode command for following links). Note that such org
links aren't properly translated to LaTeX citation commands when you
export your org file. For that, you'll need to set up a different link
type for each citation command and provide functions for exporting them
to LaTeX. The orgmode documentation explains how this is done. (You
could, in fact, create similar functions for exporting to other
formats.)

   If you use `ebib-insert-bibtex-key' in a `markdown-mode' buffer, you
can choose one of the citation commands defined for Pandoc Markdown:
`text', which inserts a citation of the form `@Jones1992', `paren',
which inserts a citation of the form `[@Jones1992]' and `year', which
inserts `[-@Jones1992]'. Since these are the only types of citations
that Pandoc Markdown knows, you shouldn't need to change anything.

   Calling Ebib from a text mode buffer has another small advantage. If
point is on a BibTeX key when Ebib is called, it jumps to that entry in
your database. This allows you to quickly check a reference in your
text. Ebib will search the entry in the current database, or, if you're
calling Ebib from a LaTeX file and there is a `\bibliography' or
`\addbibresource' command in the file, in the databases in these
commands, if they are opened in Ebib, *note Associating a Database with
a LaTeX File: #associating-a-database-with-a-latex-file. below for
details.

   There is one more command that can be useful:
`ebib-create-bib-from-bbl' creates a `.bib' file from the `.bbl' file
associated with the LaTeX document in the current buffer. This makes it
easy to create a `.bib' file containing just the BibTeX entries that
are used in the document. Note, however, that this command does not add
cross-referenced entries to the newly created `.bib' file, nor does it
add `@string' definitions and the `@preamble'. So make sure to add
those after using `ebib-create-bib-from-bbl'.

File: ebib.info,  Node: Key Bindings,  Next: Defining Citation Commands,  Up: Consulting BibTeX Databases outside Ebib

7.1 Key Bindings
================

Of course, the easiest way to use the commands discussed here is to bind
them to a key sequence. For example, the following binds `C-c b' to
`ebib-insert-bibtex-key' in AUCTeX's LaTeX mode:

(define-key 'LaTeX-mode-map "\C-cb" 'ebib-insert-bibtex-key)

   Note that commands of the form `C-c <letter>' are reserved for the
user, and should therefore not be set by any package. For this reasons,
Ebib does not set this command itself.

   `ebib-insert-bibtex-key' recognises the major mode of the buffer it
is called from and uses this information to determine which kinds of
citations to insert. So you can bind the `ebib-insert-bibtex-key' to
the same key sequence in every text mode in which you use citations and
Ebib will do the right thing.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Defining Citation Commands,  Next: Associating a Database with a LaTeX File,  Prev: Key Bindings,  Up: Consulting BibTeX Databases outside Ebib

7.2 Defining Citation Commands
==============================

As mentioned, you should probably set up some citation commands if you
use Ebib with LaTeX documents. The customisation option that allows you
to do this is "Citation Commands".

   Citation commands are defined for specific major modes. You can also
define commands for all modes under the heading `any'. (By default,
this option is used for LaTeX commands, since there is more than one
Emacs mode for (La)TeX). Each command consists of an identifier, which
you type when Ebib prompts you for a citation command, plus a format
string, which is used to create the actual citation command.

   The identifier should be a simple string which you can type easily
when Ebib asks you for a citation command (TAB completion is available,
though). The format string can contain a few directives, which are used
to add the citation key and any optional arguments. The following
directives are recognised:

`%K'
     the entry key to be inserted. `%A' an argument, for which the user
     is prompted. `%<...%>' optional material surrounding a `%A'
     directive. `%(...%<sep>)' a so-called _repeater_, which contains
     material that can be repeated. If present, the repeater must
     contain the entry key directive `%K'. `%D' a description, for
     which the user is prompted. Mainly for use in Orgmode.

   In the simplest case, the format string contains just a `%K'
directive: `\cite{%K}'. In this case, `%K' is replaced with the
citation key and the result inserted. Usually, however, citation
commands allow for optional arguments that are formatted as pre- or
postnotes to the citation. For example, using the `natbib' package, you
have citation commands available of the form:

\citet[cf.][p. 50]{Jones1992}

   In order to be able to insert such citations, the format string must
contain `%A' directives:

\citet[%A][%A]{%K}

   With such a format string, Ebib asks the user to provide text for the
two arguments and inserts it at the locations specified by the
directives. Of course, it is possible to leave the arguments empty (by
just hitting `RET'). With the format string above, this would yield the
following citation in the LaTeX buffer:

\citet[][]{Jones1992}

   The empty brackets are completely harmless, because LaTeX will simply
ignore the empty arguments. However, you may prefer for the brackets not
to appear if the arguments are empty. In that case, you can wrap the
brackets and the `%A' directives in a `%<...%>' pair:

\citet%<[%A]%>%<[%A]%>{%K}

   Now, if you leave the arguments empty, Ebib produces the following
citation:

\citet{Jones1992}

   Note however, that in this format string is problematic. If you fill
out the first argument but not the second, Ebib produces the wrong
format string:

\citet[cf.]{Jones1992}

   If only one optional argument is provided, `natbib' assumes that it
is a postnote, while what you intended is actually a prenote. Therefore,
it is best not to make the second argument optional:

\citet%<[%A]%>[%A]{%K}

   This way, the second pair of brackets is always inserted, regardless
of whether you provide a second argument or not.

   `Natbib' commands also accept multiple citation keys. When you call
`ebib-insert-bibtex-key' from within a LaTeX buffer, you can only
provide one key, but when you're in Ebib, you can mark multiple entry
keys and then use `p' to push them to a buffer. In this case, Ebib asks
you for a separator and then inserts all keys into the position of `%K':

\citet{Jones1992,Haddock2004}

   It is, however, also possible to specify in the format string that a
certain sequence can be repeated and how the different elements should
be separated. This is done by wrapping that portion of the format string
that can be repeated in a `%(...%)' pair. Normally, you'll want to
provide a separator, which is done by placing it between the `%' and
the closing parenthesis:

\citet[%A][%A]{%(%K%,)}

   This format string says that the directive `%K' can be repeated and
that multiple keys must be separated with a comma. The advantage of this
is that you are no longer asked to provide a separator.

   It is also possible to put `%A' directives in the repeating part.
This is useful for `biblatex' package, which has so-called _multicite_
commands that take the following form:

\footcites[cf.][p. 50]{Jones1992}[][p. 201]{Haddock2004}

   Multicite commands can take more than one citation key in braces
`{}' and each of those citation keys can take two optional arguments in
brackets `[]'. In order to get such citations, you can provide the
following format string:

\footcites%(%<[%A]%>[%A]{%K}%)

   Here, the entire sequence of two optional arguments and the
obligatory citation key is wrapped in `%(...%)', so that Ebib knows it
can be repeated. If you now mark multiple entries in Ebib, press `p' and
select the `footcites' command, Ebib will put all the keys in the
citation, asking you for two arguments for each citation key.

   Of course it is also possible to combine parts that are repeated with
parts that are not repeated. In fact, that already happens in the
previous example, because the part `\footcites' is not repeated.  But
the part that is not repeated may contain `%A' directives as well:

\footcites%<(%A)%>(%A)%(%<[%A]%>[%A]{%K}%)

   Multicite commands in `biblatex' take two additional arguments
surrounded with parentheses. These are pre- and postnotes for the entire
sequence of citations. They can be accommodated as shown.

   Lastly, a citation command can also contain a `%D' directive. This
is mainly for use in Orgmode citations, which take the form
`[[ebib:<key>][<description>]]'. The description is not an argument to
the citation command but the string that will be displayed in the
Orgmode buffer.

7.3 Associating a Database with a LaTeX File
============================================

The commands `ebib-insert-bibtex-key' and `ebib-entry-summary' must
consult the database or databases loaded in Ebib, and Ebib tries to be
smart about which database(s) to consult. Usually, a LaTeX file has a
`\bibliography' command somewhere toward the end, or an
`\addbibresource' command in the preamble, which names the `.bib' file
or files that contain the bibliography entries. If you consult a BibTeX
database from within a LaTeX file, Ebib first looks for one of these
commands, reads the names of the `.bib' file(s) from it, and then sees
if those files happen to be open. If they are, Ebib uses them to let
you pick an entry key (in the case of `ebib-insert-entry-key') or to
search for the entry (in the case of `ebib-entry-summary').

   Of course, it may be the case that the LaTeX file is actually part
of a bigger project, and that only the master file contains a
`\bibliography' or `\addbibresource' command. To accommodate for this,
Ebib checks whether the (buffer-local) variable `TeX-master' is set to
a filename. If it is, it reads that file and tries to find the relevant
command there. (Note: `TeX-master' is an AUCTeX variable, which is used
to keep track of multi-file projects. If you don't use AUCTeX, this
functionality doesn't work, and Ebib will only check the current file
for a `\bibliography' or `\addbibresource' command.)

   Note that if one of the `.bib' files in the `\bibliography' or
`\addbibresource' command isn't loaded, Ebib issues a warning message
about this, and continues to check for the next `.bib' file. These
warning messages appear in the minibuffer, but are probably directly
overwritten again by further messages or prompts Ebib produces, so
check the `*Messages*' buffer if Ebib doesn't seem to be able to find
an entry that you're sure is in one of your databases.

   Another thing to keep in mind is that Ebib only looks for a
`\bibliography' or `\addbibresource' command once: the first time
either `ebib-insert-bibtex-entry' or `ebib-entry-summary' is called. It
stores the result of this search and uses it the next time either of
these commands is used. Therefore, if you make a change to the
bibliography command, you must reload the file (use `M-x revert-buffer'
or `C-x C-v RET') to make sure Ebib rereads the bibliography command.

   If no `\bibliography' or `\addbibresource' command is found at all,
either in the LaTeX file itself, or in the master file, Ebib simply
consults the current database, i.e. the database that was active when
Ebib was lowered with `z'. This is also what Ebib does for Orgmode or
Pandoc Markdown files, since they do not have the equivalent of a
bibliography command. (Note, however, that you can set
`ebib-local-bibtex-filenames' to a list of `.bib' files in the
file-local variable section of a file.)


File: ebib.info,  Node: Cross-referencing,  Next: Marking Entries,  Prev: Consulting BibTeX Databases outside Ebib,  Up: Top

8 Cross-referencing
*******************

Both BibTeX and BibLaTeX have a cross-referencing facility. Suppose you
have an entry `Jones1998', which appeared in a book that is also in
your database, say under `Miller1998'. You can tell Bib(La)TeX that
`Jones1998' is contained in `Miller1998' by putting `Miller1998' in the
`crossref' field. When Bib(La)TeX finds such a cross-reference, all the
fields of `Jones1998' that don't have a value inherit their values from
`Miller1998'. At the very least, this saves you some typing, but more
importantly, if two or more entries cross-reference the same entry,
Bib(La)TeX automatically includes the cross-referenced entry in the
bibliography (and puts a reduced reference in the cross-referencing
entries).

   When you fill in the `crossref' field in Ebib, Ebib displays the
values of the cross-referenced entry in the entry buffer. To indicate
that they are just inherited values, they are marked with
`ebib-crossref-face', which by default inherits from
`font-lock-comment-face'. (You can customise it, of course. See the
customisation option "Crossref Face".) These values are merely displayed
for convenience: they cannot be edited. (They can be copied, however).

   BibTeX inheritance mechanism is rather crude: cross-referencing
entries simply inherit the fields of the same name from the
cross-referenced entry. BibLaTeX's mechanism is more sophisticated.
BibLaTeX inheritance rules depend on the field and on the types of the
cross-referencing _and_ the cross-referenced entry. Thus it is possible
to specify that the `inbook' entry type can inherit a `maintitle' field
from the `title' field if the cross-referenced entry is of type
`mvbook', and a `booktitle' field if the cross-referenced entry is of
type `book'. The inheritance scheme for BibLateX is defined by the
option "Biblatex Inheritances", which is set up with the default
inheritance relations defined by BibLaTeX, but which can be customised
if needed.

   If you're viewing an entry that has a cross-reference and you want
to go to the cross-referenced entry you can type `C'. This command reads
the value of the `crossref' field and then displays that entry. If you
want to do the reverse, i.e., see if the current entry is
cross-referenced by any other entries, you can use the same key `C': if
you type `C' on an entry that does not have a cross-reference, Ebib
makes the key of the current entry the current search string and
searches for its first occurrence after the current entry. Note that
after Ebib has jumped to the first cross-referencing entry, you cannot
type `C' again to find the next one. (Instead, it would take you back
to the cross-referenced entry.) In order to find the next
cross-referencing entry, you have to type `n', as with a normal search.
(Also, if the cross-referenced entry appears alphabetically before the
cross-referencing entry, you need to type `g' and then `n'.)

   Note that if you want to use Bib(La)TeX's cross-referencing options,
the option "Save Xrefs first" needs to be set (which it is by default).
This tells Ebib to save all entries with a `crossref' field first in the
`.bib' file. Without this, cross-referencing will not work reliably.

9 Marking Entries
*****************

Commands in the index buffer generally operate on one single entry, or
on all entries. For some commands, however, it may sometimes be useful
to perform them on more than one entry, but not necessarily all of them.
This can be achieved by selecting entries. You can select the entries
you want to perform a command on with the key `m'. This selects (or
unselects) the current entry. Selected entries are highlighted. (Note
that the face properties of selected entries can be customised through
the customisation option "Selected Face".)

   Commands for which it makes sense automatically operate on all marked
entries if there are any. Of the commands discussed so far, these are
`d' to delete entries and `p' to push entries to a LaTeX buffer. (Note
that Ebib creates a single citation command with commas separating the
entry keys.)

   The command `M' unmarks all entries or, if there are no marked
entries, marks all entries in the current database.

10 Printing the Database
************************

Sometimes it may be useful to have a `.pdf' file or print-out of your
database. Although Ebib does not actually do the printing itself, it
can create a LaTeX file for you that you can compile and print. In
fact, there are two ways of doing this.

   The print options are available in the Ebib menu when the index
buffer is active. You can print the entries as index cards or as a
bibliography.

   If you print your entries as a bibliography, Ebib creates a simple
LaTeX document that essentially contains a `\nocite{*}' command
followed by a `\bibliography' command referring to the `.bib' file
belonging to the current database. You can then run the usual sequence
of LaTeX, BibTeX, LaTeX, LaTeX on this file, creating a document
containing a list of all the references in your database.

   If you choose to print as index cards, Ebib also creates a LaTeX
file.  However, instead of simply providing a `\nocite{*}' command, this
file contains a `tabular' environment for each entry in the database
listing all the fields of that entry and their values.

   The entries are separated by a `\bigskip', but if you set the option
`Print Newpage' in the customisation buffer (or in the Print menu), the
entries are separated by a `\newpage', so that every entry is on a
separate page. The latter option is useful when printing actual index
cards (though you'd probably have to change the page size with the
`geometry' package as well).

   By default, the index cards only show single-line field values. That
is, multiline values are normally excluded. If you want to include
multiline values in the print-out, you have to set the option `Print
Multiline' in the Options menu or in Ebib's customisation buffer. With
this option set, Ebib includes all multiline values in the LaTeX file
that it creates. Note however that Ebib does not change anything about
the formatting of the text in a multiline value. So if you plan to make
(heavy) use of this option, make sure that the way you type your text
conforms to LaTeX's conventions (e.g. empty lines to mark paragraphs,
etc.) and doesn't contain any characters such as `&' that are illegal
in LaTeX. (Or, alternatively, use LaTeX code in your multiline fields.)

   As mentioned, when you "print" the database, Ebib really just
creates a LaTeX file. More precisely, it creates a temporary buffer and
writes the LaTeX code into it, and then saves the contents of that
buffer to a file. After it has done that, Ebib lowers itself and
instruct Emacs to open the file in a buffer, which will then be
properly set up as a LaTeX buffer. From there you can run LaTeX and
view the result.

   Before doing all this, Ebib asks you which file to write to. Be
careful with this: since this is supposed to be a temporary file, Ebib
simply assumes that if you provide a filename of an existing file, it
can overwrite that file without warning!

   A better way to tell Ebib which file to use is to set the option
"Print Tempfile" in Ebib's customisation buffer to some temporary file.
When this option is set, Ebib will always use this file to write to,
and will not ask you for a filename anymore.

   Note that both print options operate on all entries of the database
or on the selected entries.

   There are two more customisation options for printing the database.
These are "Print Preamble" and "LaTeX Preamble". With these options, you
can specify what Ebib should put in the preamble of the LaTeX files it
creates. Use this if you want to use specific packages. This is
especially useful for printing a bibliography, since by default, Ebib
uses BibTeX's standard bibliography style. With the option "LaTeX
Preamble" you can set your preferred bibliography style.

11 Calling a Browser
********************

With most scientific literature nowadays being available on-line, it is
common to store URLs and DOIs in a BibTeX database. (BibLaTeX of course
has standardised fields for this information.) Sometimes you may want to
load such a URL or a DOI in your browser. Ebib provides a convenient way
for doing so.

   If you type `u' in the index buffer, Ebib takes the URL stored in
the `url' field of the current entry and passes it to your browser.
Furthermore, in the entry buffer, you can use `u' on _any_ field. If
you happen to have more than one URL stored in the relevant field, Ebib
will ask you which one you want to open. Alternatively, you can use a
prefix argument: typing `M-2 u' sends the second URL to your browser.

   It is not even necessary that the relevant field contains _only_
URLs. It may contain other text mixed with the URLs: Ebib simply
searches the URLs in the field and ignores the rest of the text. Ebib
considers every string of characters that starts with `http://' or
`https://' and that does not contain whitespace or any of the
characters `" ' ; <' or `>' as a URL. The semicolon is included here
even though it is actually a valid character in URLs. This is done for
consistency, because the semicolon (actually, semicolon+space) is the
standard separator for files in the `file' field and in this way, you
can use the same separator to distinguish multiple URLs in the `url'
field. By default Ebib also regards everything that is enclosed in a
LaTeX `\url{...}' command as a URL. So if you use `;' to separate URLs
and then happen to run into a URL that contains a semicolon, you can
enclose it in `\url{...}' and it will be recognised properly. You can,
of course, customise the regular expression that controls this
behaviour.  See the option "Url Regexp" for details.

   Similarly, with the key `i' in the index buffer you can send a DOI
to a browser. The DOI must be stored in the `doi' field. Unlike URLs,
there can only be one DOI in this field. The whole contents of the
field is assumed to be the DOI and is sent to the browser. Ebib adds the
URL `http://dx.doi.org/' before sending the DOI to the browser, so the
`doi' field should contain just the DOI itself.

   Ebib uses the Emacs function `browse-url' to call the default
browser on the system. If you prefer to use another browser, however,
you can specify this with the option "Browser Command". You can also
customise the field that Ebib takes URLs from, with the option "Standard
Url Field". The same can be done for the DOI field.

12 Viewing Files
****************

If you have electronic versions of the papers in your database stored on
your computer, or any other file associated with your entries (e.g.,
notes, if you store those in separate files) you can use Ebib to call
external viewers for these files or have them opened in Emacs. The
interface for this is similar to that for calling a browser: if you
press `f' in the index buffer, Ebib searches the `file' field for a
filename and when it finds one, calls an appropriate viewer. And just
as with `u', you can use `f' in the entry buffer as well, in which case
it can be used on any field, not just the `file' field. It is also
possible to have more than one filename in a field. In that case, Ebib
asks you which one you want to open. If you want to open the first one
you can just hit ENTER. Alternatively, you can provide a prefix
argument: `M-2 f' for the second file, etc.

   The file names in the `file' field do not have to have full paths.
You can set the option "File Search Dirs" to a list of directories that
Ebib should search when opening a file from the `file' field. Note that
Ebib searches only the directories in this list, not their
subdirectories. However, you can specify a relative path in the `file'
field: if you put something like `a/Abney1987.pdf' in the `file' field,
Ebib searches for the relevant file in a subdirectory `a/' of the
directories listed in the option "File Search Dirs". As an extra
service, Ebib also searches for the base filename, i.e., `Abney1987' in
this particular case.

   Ebib can call different external programs depending on the file
extension of the relevant file. The option "File Associations" allows
you to specify which programs to call for which types of files. By
default, `.pdf' and `.ps' files are handled, by `xpdf' and `gv',
respectively. You can specify further file types by their extensions
(do not include the dot). The program is searched for in `PATH', but
you can of course specify the full path to the program.  There is also
the option to open files in Emacs. Use this if you have separate text
files for notes, or if you want to read pdf files in Emacs with
`doc-view-mode'.

* Editing the file field::


File: ebib.info,  Node: Editing the file field,  Up: Viewing Files

12.1 Editing the `file' field
=============================

As mentioned above, editing the `file' field is a bit different from
editing other fields. Instead of typing the full contents of the file
field, you are asked to specify a single file name. When you hit ENTER,
Ebib adds the filename to the `file' field, appending it no any
existing contents (adding a separator if necessary), and then asks you
for the next file. If you don't want to add another, just hit ENTER.
The default separator is `"; "' (semicolon-space), but this can be
customised (see the option "Filename Separator" for details). The
advantage of this method is that you can use TAB completion to complete
file names.

   The first directory in the option "File Search Dirs" is used as the
starting directory for filename completion when editing the `file'
field. Note that when completing file names, Ebib does not take the
directories in "File Search Dirs" into account: completion is done using
the standard Emacs file name completion mechanism. However, when you
enter a file name, Ebib checks if it is in a (subdirectory of) one of
the directories in "File Search Dirs", and if so, cuts off the relevant
part of the file name to turn it into a relative path.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Window Management,  Next: Creating Entry Stubs,  Prev: Viewing Files,  Up: Top

13 Window Management
********************

By default, Ebib takes over the entire Emacs frame it is started in,
displaying the index window at the top and the entry window below it.
There are a few options to change this behaviour, however. They are all
part of the customisation group `ebib-windows', and allow you to
specify two alternative ways to deal with Ebib windows. The main layout
option is simply called "Layout" and has three options: use the full
frame (the default), use the right part of the frame, or display only
the index window.

   If you set the layout to use only the right part of the frame, the
Ebib buffers are displayed on the right of the frame, with the (usually
larger) left part of the frame displaying some other buffer. The width
of the Ebib windows can be set with the option "Width", which defaults
to 80, and which can be specified as an absolute value (the number of
columns), but also as a value relative to the current window. In that
case, you must specify a value between 0 and 1. Note that when this
option is used, the key `z' does not hide the Ebib buffers, it simply
switches to a non-Ebib window in the same frame. You can use
(uppercase) `Z' to hide the Ebib buffers. Furthermore, with this
option, the multiline edit buffer is not displayed in the same window as
the entry buffer. Rather, Ebib uses another, non-Ebib window to display
it.

   The third option that Ebib provides is to only show the index buffer
on start-up. In this case, Ebib does not display the entry buffer when
it is started. Instead, only the index buffer is displayed, which can be
navigated in the usual manner. The entry buffer is only displayed when
you add or edit an entry. When you've finished editing and move back to
the index buffer, the entry buffer is hidden again.

   The entry buffer is also displayed if you press `RET'. When you do
this, the index buffer remains selected, so you can use this to display
the fields of an entry without moving focus to the entry window. If you
navigate the index buffer, the entry buffer remains visible, updating
its contents as you move around.

   In this case, too, the key `z' does not hide the index window.
Rather, it just selects another, non-Ebib window. In order to hide the
index window, you can use (uppercase) `Z'.

   If you set Ebib's layout to display only the index buffer on startup,
you can additionally set the option "Popup Entry Window". Normally, Ebib
will reuse an existing window to display the entry buffer (and restore
its original buffer when you leave the entry buffer). With this option
set, however, Ebib uses the Emacs function
`display-buffer-popup-window' to create a new window (which is
destroyed again when you leave the entry buffer).

   Further relevant options are "Window Vertical Split", which displays
the index buffer to the left of the frame rather than at the top, and
"Index Window Size", which determines the size of the index window
(either its height or its width, depending on whether the index window
is displayed at the top or on the left of the frame.)

14 Creating Entry Stubs
***********************

If you have a directory full of (pdf) files of articles that you want to
add to your database, Ebib can make the task a little bit easier by
creating entry stubs for all the files. You can do this with the command
`M-x ebib-add-file-entry'. This command asks you for a file or a
directory and creates an entry in the current database for that file or
each file in the directory. The entries only contain a file field
pointing to the file, all the other information still has to be filled
out by hand, but this way you can at least keep track of which files are
already in your database.

   Note that the entry keys for the stubs are temporary keys. They will
be replaced by more permanent keys automatically when you edit the
entries.  This behaviour is controlled by the function
`bibtex-generate-autokey', which has a number of customisation options.
Check out its doc string for details. If you prefer to edit the keys by
hand, you can do so by pressing `E' in the index buffer.


File: ebib.info,  Node: @Preamble Definition,  Next: @String Definitions,  Prev: Creating Entry Stubs,  Up: Top

15 @Preamble Definition
***********************

Apart from database entries, BibTeX allows three more types of elements
to appear in a `.bib' file. These are `@comment', `@preamble' and
`@string' definitions. Ebib provides facilities to handle these, which
are discussed here and in the following sections.

   Ebib allows you to add one `@preamble' definition to the database.
In principle, BibTeX allows more than one such definition, but really
one suffices, because you can use the concatenation character `#' to
include multiple TeX or LaTeX commands. So, rather than having two
`@preamble' definitions such as:

@preamble{ "\newcommand{\noopsort}[1]{} " }
@preamble{ "\newcommand{\singleletter}[1]{#1} " }

   you can write this in your `.bib' file:

@preamble{ "\newcommand{\noopsort}[1]{} "
         # "\newcommand{\singleletter}[1]{#1} " }

   Creating or editing a `@preamble' definition in Ebib is done by
hitting (uppercase) `P' in the index buffer. Ebib uses the multiline
edit buffer for editing the text of the `@preamble' definition, which
means that `C-c | q' stores the `@preamble' text and returns focus to
the index buffer, while `C-c | c' returns focus to the index buffer
while abandoning any changes you may have made. (For details on using
the multiline edit buffer, see *note The Multiline Edit Buffer:
#the-multiline-edit-buffer.)

   In order to create a `@preamble' as shown above in Ebib, you only
have to type the text between the braces. Ebib takes care of including
the braces of the `@preamble' command, but otherwise it saves the text
exactly as you enter it. So in order to get the preamble above, you'd
have to type the following in Ebib:

"\newcommand{\noopsort}[1]{} " # "\newcommand{\singleletter}[1]{#1} "

   Note that when Ebib loads a `.bib' file that contains more than one
`@preamble' definition, it concatenates all the strings in them in the
manner just described and saves them in one `@preamble' definition.


File: ebib.info,  Node: @String Definitions,  Next: @Comments,  Prev: @Preamble Definition,  Up: Top

16 @String Definitions
**********************

If you press (uppercase) `S' in the index buffer, Ebib hides the entry
buffer in the lower window and replaces it with the _strings buffer_.
In this buffer, you can add, delete and edit `@string' definitions.

   Adding a `@string' definition is done with the command `a'.  This
will first ask you for an abbreviation and then for the value to be
associated with that abbreviation. Once you've entered these, Ebib will
sort the new abbreviation into the buffer.

   Moving between the `@string' definitions can be done in the usual
way: the cursor keys `up' and `down', `C-p' and `C-n' and `k' and `j'
move up and down. `Space' and `PgDn' move ten strings down, while `b'
and `PgUp' move in the other direction. The keys `g', `G', `Home' and
`End' also function as expected.

   To delete a `@string' definition, use `d'. To edit the value of a
definition, use `e'. There is also a command `c', which copies the
value of the current `@string' definition to the kill ring. Unlike in
the entry buffer, there are no corresponing commands `y' and `x'. (In
fact, `x' does exist, but has another function.) Yanking from the kill
ring can be done with `C-y/M-y' in the minibuffer when you edit a
`@string''s value. Cutting a `@string''s value is pointless, because a
`@string' definition must have a value.

   Having defined `@string' definitions, there must of course be a way
to use them. Just giving a field a string abbreviation as value will
not do, because Ebib puts braces around the value that you enter when it
writes the `.bib' file, so that BibTeX will not recognise the
abbreviation, and will not expand it. BibTeX will only recognise an
abbreviation if it appears in the `.bib' file outside of any braces.

   To accomplish this, you must mark a field's value as special. A
special field is a field whose value is not surrounded by braces when
the database is saved, so that BibTeX recognises it as an abbreviation.
To mark a field special, press `r'. An asterisk will appear before the
field, indicating that has no braces. Pressing `r' again will change
the field back to normal. If you press `r' on a field that does not
have a value yet, Ebib will ask you for one.

   Note that this also makes it possible to enter field values that are
composed of concatenations of strings and abbreviations. The BibTeX
documentation for example explains that if you have defined:

@string{WGA = "World Gnus Almanac"}

   you can create a BibTeX field like this:

title = 1966 # WGA

   which will produce "1966 World Gnus Almanac". Or you can do:

month = "1~" # jan

   which will produce someting like "1 January", assuming your
bibliography style has defined the abbreviation `jan'. All this is
possible with Ebib, simply by entering the exact text including quotes
or braces around the strings, and marking the relevant field as special.

   An easy way to enter a `@string' abbreviation as a field value is to
use the key `s' instead of `e'. If you type `s', Ebib asks you for a
`@string' abbreviation to put in the current field, and automatically
marks the field as special. With this command, Ebib only accepts
`@string' definitions that are in the database, so that by using `s'
you can make sure you don't make any typos. Note that you can use TAB
completion to complete a partial string.


File: ebib.info,  Node: @Comments,  Next: Managing Keywords,  Prev: @String Definitions,  Up: Top

17 @Comments
************

If Ebib finds a `@comment' in a `.bib' file, it will read it and store
it in the database. When the database is saved, all the `@comment's
will be saved with it, at the top of the file (right after the
`@preamble'.) There is no way to edit comments, nor can you specify
where in the `.bib' file a comment is placed, but they won't be lost.

18 Managing Keywords
********************

Ebib provides some special functionality for handling keywords. By
default, there is a `keywords' field in the list of extra fields.
Editing this field is a bit different from other fields. Instead of just
entering a string and hitting ENTER to store it and return to the entry
buffer, you should enter a single keyword and hit enter. The keyword
will then be added to the keywords already present and you are asked to
enter the next keyword. If you've added all keywords you want, just hit
ENTER to finish.

   The advantage of doing it this way is that you can reuse keywords:
once you've added a keyword to one entry, Ebib remembers it. The next
time you want to use the same keyword for a different entry, you just
need to type the first (few) letters, hit TAB and the keyword will be
completed.  That makes it easier to ensure you use the exact same
keywords in different entries. Note that Ebib's keyword functionality
is not used to check the contents of keyword fields. It is simply a way
to make it easier to stick to specific keywords, which should make it
easier to categorise and search your entries.

   It is still possible to edit the `keywords' field directly. To do
so, use a prefix argument: `C-u e' (or any other prefix argument) on
the `keywords' field will allow you to edit the entire contents in the
normal way. Use this method if you want to remove single keywords.
(Blanking the entire `keywords' field is quicker with `x' or `d'.)

   It is also possible to add keywords to an entry from the index
buffer, using the command `K a' (`ebib-keywords-add'). This works
essentially the same way as when adding keywords from the entry buffer.
There is one advantage, however: this command can also operate on marked
entries, so that you can add keywords to multiple entries in one go.

   Remembering keywords is practical, but it is even more useful if
remembered keywords can be saved, so that they are available the next
time you start Ebib. There are two ways of doing this: first, there is
an option "Keywords List" that you can use to store keywords. Keywords
stored in this option will be available for TAB completion to all
databases in Ebib. New keywords, however, will not automatically be
stored. If you find you need a keyword not on the list and want to make
it permanent, you'll have to add it to "Keywords List" yourself.

   The other way of making keywords permanent is by storing them in a
file.  Ebib offers two ways of doing this (which are mutually
exclusive, so you have to choose one). You can either configure a
single keyword file, with keywords that are available to all databases,
or you can configure per-directory keyword files, with keywords that
are available for all `.bib' files in the same directory. You can set
up keyword files by configuring the option "Keywords File". You can
either set it to use a single keyword file, in which case you need to
specify a file with its full path, or you can use per-directory keyword
files, in which case you must provide a filename without a path. That
is, if you use per-directory keyword files, the files have the same
name in each directory. The default name is `ebib-keywords.txt', but
you can change that if you like, of course.

   Keywords that have not been made permanent are marked as such in the
entry buffer in `ebib-nonpermanent-keyword-face', (usually a red
foreground colour, but this can be customised). If you run into such
keywords and want to make them permanent, use the command `K s'.  This
will take the keywords in the `keywords' field of the current entry and
store all keywords that are not permanent yet.

   Keyword files have a very simple format: they are text files with one
keyword per line. So you can easily create or edit keyword files by
hand, or have them created by some other programme. Keep in mind,
though, that Ebib does not check for changes to keyword files. If you
have a single keyword file, it is loaded when Ebib starts up;
per-directory keyword files are loaded when the first `.bib' file in
that directory is opened. If you open a second `.bib' file from the
same directory, Ebib won't reload the keywords file.

   When you close a database, Ebib checks if you have added new
keywords to it and asks you if you want to save them. You can tell Ebib
to save new keywords automatically by setting the option "Keywords File
Save On Exit" to `always'. Note that this doesn't save the keywords when
you enter them, only when you close the database or quit Ebib. You can
also set this option to `never', which means Ebib will discard new
keywords when the database is closed. Note that if you want to save the
keywords file without having to close the database, you can do so
through the menu.

   The option "Keywords Use Only File" controls whether Ebib uses only
the keyword file, or both the keyword file and the configured keyword
list.  This option is only useful when you have configured a keyword
file. In that case, setting this option to use both the keyword list
and the keyword file tells Ebib to offer keywords from both sources
when you edit the keyword field. Otherwise, only the keyword file is
used.

   It is also possible to tell Ebib to sort the keywords in the
`keywords' field in alphabetical order. Set the option "Keywords Field
Keep Sorted" if you want to do this. Note that setting this option also
automatically removes duplicates.

   Lastly, you can configure the separator used between keywords in the
keyword field. By default, it is set to `", "', i.e., comma-space.
(The separator is a comma because that is what BibLaTeX expects in the
`keywords' field.) If you change it, keep in mind that Ebib does not
add a space between keywords, so if you want a space, make sure to add
it to the separator.

19 Sorting the `.bib' File
**************************

By default, the entries in the database are saved to the `.bib' file in
alphabetical order according to entry key. If you only deal with the
`.bib' file through Ebib, you may not care in which order the entries
are saved. However, it may sometimes be desirable to be able to specify
the sort order of entries in more detail. (Apparently, this can be
useful with ConTeXt, for example.)

   You can specify a sort order in Ebib's customisation buffer. To sort
the entries, you must set at least one sort level (that is, a field to
sort the entries on). You can also specify more than one sort level: if
two entries have identical values for the first sort level, they will be
sorted on the second sort level. E.g., if the first sort level is
`author' and the second is `year', then the entries are sorted by
author, and those entries that have identical values for the `author'
field are sorted by year.

   A sort level is not restricted to a single field. You can specify
more fields for a single sort level. Within a single sort level, a
second sort field is used if the first sort field does not have a
value. For example, books that have an editor instead of an author will
have an empty `author' field. If you sort the database on the `author'
field, such entries will all appear at the beginning of the `.bib'
file, which is most likely not what you want.

   To remedy this, you can specify both the `author' and the `editor'
fields for the first sort level. Ebib will then sort an entry on its
`author' field if it has a value, and will otherwise use the value of
the `editor' field.

   The difference between two sort fields within one sort level and two
sort levels is that a second sort _field_ is an alternative for the
first field when it has no value, while a second sort _level_ is an
additional sort criterion when two or more entries cannot be sorted on
the first level, because they have identical values.

   By default, the option `Sort Order' has no value, which means that
the entries in the `.bib' file are sorted according to entry key.
Those that wish to customise the sort order will usually want to set the
first sort level to `author editor', and the second to `year'.  In that
way, the entries in the `.bib' file are sorted according to
author/editor, and entries with the same author/editor are sorted by
year.

   Entries that cannot be sorted on some sort level, because the sort
fields are empty, are sorted on entry key. (Keep in mind that if the
first sort level yields _no value_ for a specific entry, Ebib does
_not_ use the second sort level to sort that entry. It uses the entry
key. The second sort level is only used if the first yields _identical_
values for two or more entries.)

   Note that if you wish to make use of this option, you need to unset
the option "Save Xrefs First" (*note Cross-referencing:
#cross-referencing.).  It is pointless to set a sort order if
cross-referenced entries are saved first. Since "Save Xrefs First" is
set by default, you need to unset if you set "Sort Order".

20 Merging and Importing
************************

As described in the previous chapter, adding entries to a database can
be done manually with the key `a'. There are other ways of adding
entries to a database, however.

   In the index buffer, the Ebib menu has an option to merge a second
`.bib' file into the current database. Ebib reads the entries in this
file and adds them to the database. Duplicate entries (that is, entries
with an entry key that already exists in the database) will normally
not be loaded. Ebib logs a warning about each duplicate entry to its
log buffer and displays a warning after loading the `.bib' file when
this happens. However, if you've customised Ebib to automatically
generate keys, duplicate entries will be merged into the current
database under a unique key.

   Another way to add entries to a database is to import them from an
Emacs buffer. If, for example, you find ready-formatted BibTeX entries
in a text file or on the internet, you can copy & paste them to any
Emacs buffer (e.g. the `*scratch*' buffer), and then execute the command
`M-x ebib-import'. Ebib then goes through the buffer and loads all
BibTeX entries it finds into the current database (i.e. the database
that was active when you lowered Ebib). If you call `ebib-import' while
the region is active, Ebib only reads the BibTeX entries in the region.

   If a BibTeX entry in the buffer lack an entry key (which sometimes
happens with BibTeX entries found on the internet), Ebib will generate a
temporary key for it of the form `<new-keyXX>', where `XX' is a number.
You can change such keys by hitting `E' in the index buffer. They will
also automatically be replaced with a more sensible key when you edit
them. See the option "Autogenerate Keys" for details.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Exporting Entries,  Next: Timestamps,  Prev: Merging and Importing,  Up: Top

21 Exporting Entries
********************

Sometimes it can be useful to copy entries from one database to another,
or to create a new `.bib' file with several entries from an existing
database. For this purpose, Ebib provides exporting facilities.  To
export an entry to a `.bib' file, use the command `x'. This command
operates on a single entry or on all marked entries.

   When you export one or more entries, Ebib will ask you for a
filename to export them to. If you have already exported an entry
before, Ebib will present the filename you used as default, but you can
of course change it. For obvious reasons, Ebib appends the entry to the
file that you enter if it already exists, it does not overwrite the
file. If this is not what you want, delete the file first, as Ebib
provides no way to do this.

   If you have more than one database open in Ebib, it is also possible
to copy entries from one database to another. To do this, use the `x'
command with a numeric prefix argument. E.g., if the database you want
to export an entry to is the second database, type `M-2 x' to export
the current entry to it. The number of the database is given in the
modeline of the index buffer. If the database you're copying an entry
to already contains an entry with the same entry key, Ebib won't copy
the entry, and issues an appropriate warning message.

   Apart from entries, it is also possible to export the `@preamble'
and `@string' definitions. The `@preamble' definition is exported with
the command `X' in the index buffer. `@string' definitions can be
exported in the strings buffer: `x' in this buffer exports the current
string, while `X' exports all `@string' definitions in one go. All
these commands function in the same way: when used without a prefix
argument, they ask for a filename, and then append the relevent data to
that file. With a numeric prefix argument, they copy the relevant data
to the corresponding open database.

22 Timestamps
*************

Ebib provides the possibility to add a timestamp to every new entry,
recording the time it was added to the database. The timestamp is
recorded in the (extra) field `timestamp'. (By default, this field is
not shown, but you can make it visible by checking the option "Show
Hidden Fields" in the Options menu.)

   You can tell Ebib to create timestamps by setting the option `Use
Timestamp' in Ebib's customisation buffer. With this option set, a
timestamp is included in entries added to the database with `a'. Ebib
will also add a timestamp to entries imported from a buffer or merged
from a file, and to entries exported to another database or to a file.
When importing or exporting entries, existing timestamps will be
overwritten. The logic behind this is that the timestamp records the
date and time when the entry was added to the database, not when it was
first created.

   Note that if this option is unset, the timestamp of an entry is
retained when it's imported or exported. Therefore, if you record
timestamps and want to im-/export entries without changing their
timestamps, temporarily unset this option.

   Ebib uses the function `format-time-string' to create the timestamp.
The format string that Ebib uses can be customised in Ebib's
customisation buffer. The default string is `"%a %b' `%e %T %Y"', which
produces a timestamp of the form `"Mon Mar 12 01:03:26 2007"'.
Obviously, this string is not suited for sorting, so if you want to be
able to sort on timestamps, you'll need to customise the format string.
See the documentation for `format-time-string' on the options that are
available.

23 Multiple Identical Fields
****************************

Under normal circumstances, a BibTeX entry only contains one occurrence
of each field. If BibTeX notices that an entry contains more than one
occurrence of an required or optional field, it issues a warning. Ebib
is somewhat less gracious, it simply takes the value of the last
occurrence without giving any warning. (Note, by the way, that BibTeX
will use the value of the _first_ occurrence, not the last.) When extra
fields appear more than once in an entry, BibTeX does not warn you,
since it ignores those fields anyway. Here, too, Ebib's standard
behaviour is to ignore all but the last value.

   However, some online reference management services "use" this
feature of BibTeX in that they put multiple `keywords' fields in the
BibTeX entries that they produce. If you were to import such an entry
into Ebib, you would lose all your keywords except the last one. To
remedy this, you can tell Ebib that it should allow multiple
occurrences of a single field in a BibTeX entry. You can do this by
setting the customisation option "Allow Identical Fields".

   With this option set, Ebib collapses the multiple occurrences into a
single occurrence. All the values of the different occurrences are
collected and stored in the single occurrence, separated by colons
(actually, the value of the option "Keywords Separator"). That is, Ebib
does not retain the multiple occurrences, but it does retain the values.
So suppose you have an entry that contains the following `keywords'
fields:

@book{Jones1998,
    author = {Jones, Joan},
    year = {1998},
    ...
    keywords = {sleep},
    keywords = {winter},
    keywords = {hibernation}
}

   If you load this entry into Ebib with the option "Allow Identical
Fields" set, you will get the following:

@book{Jones1998,
    author = {Jones, Joan},
    year = {1998},
    ...
    keywords = {sleep, winter, hibernation}
}


File: ebib.info,  Node: The Multiline Edit Buffer,  Next: The Options Menu,  Prev: Multiple Identical Fields,  Up: Top

24 The Multiline Edit Buffer
****************************

As mentioned several times before, Ebib has a special multiline edit
buffer, which is used to edit field values that contain newlines
(so-called _multiline fields_), and also to edit the contents of the
`@preamble' command. This section discusses the details of this buffer.

   Ebib enters multiline edit mode in one of three cases: when you edit
the `@preamble' definition, when you hit `m' in the entry buffer to
edit the current field as multiline, or when you hit `e' on the
`annote' field, or on a field whose value already is multiline.

   The mode that is used in the multiline edit buffer is
user-configurable.  The default value is `text-mode', but if you prefer
to use some other mode, you can specify this through the customisation
options.  (Personally, I use `markdown-mode' in the multiline edit
buffer, so that I can use `Markdown'
(http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to write annotations,
which provides an easy way to create headers, use bold and italic,
etc., in plain text.)

   Three commands are relevant for interacting with Ebib when you're in
the multiline edit buffer, which are bound to key sequences in the minor
mode `ebib-multiline-edit-mode', which is activated automatically in
the multiline edit buffer.

   `ebib-quit-multiline-buffer-and-save', bound to `C-c | q', leaves
the multiline edit buffer and stores the text in the database. If you
invoke this command when you've deleted all contents of the buffer
(including the final newline!) and you were editing a field value or the
`@preamble', the field value or preamble is deleted. (This is in fact
the _only_ way to delete the `@preamble' definition.  Field values on
the other hand can also be deleted by hitting `x' or `d' on them in the
entry buffer.) If you were editing a `@string' value, Ebib will just
complain, because string definitions cannot be empty.

   `ebib-cancel-multiline-buffer', bound to `C-c | c', also leaves the
multiline edit buffer, but it does so without storing the text. The
original value of the field, string or preamble will be retained. If
the text was modified, Ebib will ask for a confirmation before leaving
the buffer.

   `ebib-save-from-multiline-buffer', bound to `C-c | s', can be used
in the multiline edit buffer to save the database. This command first
stores the text in the database and then saves it. Because Ebib does
not do an autosave of the current database, it is advisable to save the
database manually every now and then to prevent data loss in case of
crashes. It would be annoying to have to leave the multiline edit buffer
every time you want to do this, so this command has been provided to
allow you to do this from within the buffer.

   Admittedly, the key combinations of the multiline edit buffer are
somewhat awkward. The reason for this is that these commands are part of
a minor mode, which restricts the available keys to combinations of
`C-c' plus a non-alphanumeric character. However, it is possible to
change the key commands, if you wish. Ebib itself provides a method to
change the second key of these commands, *note Modifying Key Bindings:
#modifying-key-bindings. You could change the `|' to e.g., `c' or
`C-c', if these do not conflict with any key commands in the major mode
used for the multiline edit buffer.

   Even more drastically, you could put something like the following in
your `~/.emacs':

(eval-after-load 'ebib
  '(progn
     (define-key ebib-multiline-mode-map
                 "\C-c\C-c" 'ebib-quit-multiline-buffer-and-save)
     (define-key ebib-multiline-mode-map
                 "\C-c\C-q" 'ebib-cancel-multiline-buffer)
     (define-key ebib-multiline-mode-map
                 "\C-c\C-s" 'ebib-save-from-multiline-buffer)))

   This sets up `C-c C-c', `C-c C-q' and `C-c C-s' for use in the
multiline edit buffer. Since such key combinations are restricted for
use with major modes, however, Ebib cannot set these up automatically,
but as an Emacs user, you are free do do as you like, of course.

25 The Options Menu
*******************

In the index buffer, Ebib's menu has an Options submenu. This menu gives
you quick access to Ebib's customisation buffer, and it also provides
checkboxes for several settings that can be toggled on and off. All of
these settings have defaults that can be defined in the customisation
buffer. Setting or unsetting them in the Options menu only changes them
for the duration of your Emacs session, it doesn't affect the default
setting.

   The same is true for the printing options that are in the Print menu.
When set or unset in the menu, the default values specified in the
customisation buffer do not change.

File: ebib.info,  Node: Customisation,  Prev: The Ebib Buffers,  Up: Top

27 Customisation
****************

Ebib can be customised through Emacs' standard customisation interface.
The relevant customisation group is (obviously) called `ebib', which
has four subgroups: `ebib-faces', `ebib-filters', and `ebib-keywords',
whose functions should be obvious, and `ebib-windows', where options
for Ebib's window management can be set. All options are documented in
the customisation buffers. You can go to Ebib's customisation buffer
with `M-x customize-group RET ebib RET', or by using the menu «Ebib |
Options | Customize Ebib».

   Another way to customise Ebib is to use the initialisation file
`~/.emacs.d/ebibrc'. (Actually, the location and name of this file can
be customised as well.) This file contains normal Lisp code and is the
best way to customise key bindings (as discussed in the next section),
but it can in fact be used to run any Lisp code.

* Modifying Key Bindings::


File: ebib.info,  Node: Modifying Key Bindings,  Up: Customisation

27.1 Modifying Key Bindings
===========================

If you would like to change Ebib's standard key bindings, or if you
would like to bind a command that is only available through the menu to
a key, you can do so by creating a file `~/.emacs.d/ebibrc' and writing
your preferred key bindings in it. A key binding can be defined as
follows:

(ebib-key <buffer> <key> <command>)

   `<buffer>' is either `index', `entry' or `strings', for the
corresponding buffer. `<key>' is a standard Emacs key description, and
`<command>' is the Ebib command to be associated with the key (which
does not have to be quoted, unlike `define-key' and friends). The
commands that can be used here are listed in *note The Ebib Buffers:
#the-ebib-buffers. Note that it is possible to bind more than one key
to a single function: just add as many `ebib-key' statements as
necessary.

   As an example, the following binds `C-s' to `ebib-search' in the
index buffer, so that the database can be searched with `C-s' as well
as with `/':

(ebib-key index "\C-s" ebib-search)

   If you want to unbind a key, you can simply leave out `<command>'.
So if you want to bind the command `ebib-delete-entry' to `D' rather
than `d', you need to put the following in `~/.emacs.d/ebibrc':

(ebib-key index "D" ebib-delete-entry)
(ebib-key index "d")

   The first line binds `D' to the command `ebib-delete-entry'.  The
second line unbinds `d'.

   `ebib-key' allows you to redefine the second key in the key bindings
of the multiline edit buffer:

(ebib-key multiline "&")

   This piece of code changes the commands `C-c | q', `C-c | c' and
`C-c | s' to `C-c & q', `C-c & c' and `C-c & s', respectively.

   Alternatively, if you find these key bindings awkward, you could put
something like the following code in `~/.emacs.d/ebibrc':

(define-key ebib-multiline-mode-map
            "\C-c\C-c" 'ebib-quit-multiline-buffer-and-save)
(define-key ebib-multiline-mode-map
            "\C-c\C-q" 'ebib-cancel-multiline-buffer)
(define-key ebib-multiline-mode-map
            "\C-c\C-s" 'ebib-save-from-multiline-buffer)

   This will bind the relevant commands to `C-c C-c', `C-c C-q' and C-c
C-s`, which are of course more convenient than the standard key
bindings.
