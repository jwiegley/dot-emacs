Support for Isabelle/classic has been removed from Proof General.

The default and only supported interface is now Isabelle/Isar.

If you need to use an older version of Isabelle, you will have
to use an older version of Proof General (and so perhaps an older
version of Emacs...).  Apologies for the incovnenience.
