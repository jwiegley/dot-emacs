This excellent feature inspired Capture in OrgMode and that is now (Aug2010) recommended for new users, see http://orgmode.org/manual/Capture.html#Capture
[new]


== Introduction ==

Todo lists, schedules, phone databases... everything we use
databases for is really just a way to extend the power of our
memory.  To be able to remember what our conscious mind may not
currently have access to.

There are many different databases out there -- and good ones --
which this mode is not trying to replace.  Rather, it's how that
data gets there that's the question.  Most of the time, we just
want to say "Remember so-and-so's phone number, or that I have to
buy dinner for the cats tonight."  That's the FACT.  How it's
stored is really the computer's problem.  But at this point in
time, it's most definitely also the user's problem, and sometimes
so laboriously so that people just let data slip, rather than
expend the effort to record it.

"Remember" is a mode for remembering data.  It uses whatever
back-end is appropriate to record and correlate the data, but its
main intention is to allow you to express as _little_ structure as
possible up front.  If you later want to express more powerful
relationships between your data, or state assumptions that were at
first too implicit to be recognized, you can "study" the data later
and rearrange it.  But the initial "just remember this" impulse
should be as close to simply throwing the data at Emacs as
possible.

Remember is often used in conjunction with PlannerMode and/or OrgMode.

== Installation ==

Here, we assume that Planner will be unpacked to the ##~/elisp##
directory.  It can be placed anywhere you like, really, but this
is a fairly standard spot to place Emacs Lisp stuff.

=== Getting a release ===

You have two options: stable or development.

==== Getting the stable release ====

Using a tarball:

<pre>
wget http://download.gna.org/remember-el/remember-2.0.tar.gz
tar -xzf remember-2.0.tar.gz
mv remember-2.0 remember
</pre>

Using a zip file:

<pre>
wget http://download.gna.org/remember-el/remember-2.0.zip
unzip remember-2.0.zip
mv remember-2.0 remember
</pre>

==== Getting the latest development snapshot ====

Using git:

<pre>
cd ~/elisp
git clone git://repo.or.cz/remember-el.git remember
</pre>

If you are behind a restrictive firewall and wish to use git, then do the following instead:

<pre>
cd ~/elisp
git clone http://repo.or.cz/r/remember-el.git remember
</pre>

Using a downloaded tarball:

<pre>
cd ~/elisp
wget http://mwolson.org/static/dist/remember-latest.tar.gz
tar -xzf remember-latest.tar.gz
</pre>

Using a downloaded zip file:

<pre>
cd ~/elisp
wget http://mwolson.org/static/dist/remember-latest.zip
tar -xzf remember-latest.zip
</pre>

=== Setting up ===

[new]
Now that RememberMode is included in Emacs (as of Emacs 23), activation is as simple as:
    (require 'remember)
[new]

After unpacking, install Remember by copying the directory "remember" to a nice spot on the hard drive, say ##~/elisp/remember##.  Add to your .emacs the following statements:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp/remember")

==== Setting up for OrgMode ====

[new]
Now that OrgMode and RememberMode are included in Emacs (as of Emacs 23), activation is as simple as:
    (org-remember-insinuate)

Note that there is no need for:
    (require 'remember)
[new]

Basically you should follow the instructions in the org-mode info file. However this currently forgets that you also need something like this in your .emacs:

    (require 'remember)

If you are, like me, missing the function org-remember-insinuate, try the following

    (setq remember-annotation-functions '(org-remember-annotation))
    (setq remember-handler-functions '(org-remember-handler))
    (add-hook 'remember-mode-hook 'org-remember-apply-template)

===== Quick note-taking =====

When you have started your emacs server (<tt>emacs --daemon</tt> in Emacs 23 or above), you can open a new frame for quick note-taking with:

    $ emacsclient -e "(remember-other-frame)"

[new]
Note: <tt>remember</tt> now includes <tt>remember-other-frame</tt> so if you get an "Autoloading failed to define function", remove the following <tt>defadvice</tt> from your <tt>.emacs</tt>
[new]

For older versions you may also want that frame like a pop-up for temporal editing add this code to your init file:

    (defadvice remember-other-frame (around remember-frame-parameters activate)
      "Set some frame parameters for the remember frame."
      (let ((default-frame-alist (append
    			      '(
    				(name . "*Remember*")
    				(width . 80)
    				(height . 10)
    				(vertical-scroll-bars . nil)
    				(menu-bar-lines . 0)
    				(tool-bar-lines . 0)
    				)
    			      default-frame-alist)))
        ad-do-it
        ))

Note that <tt>-c</tt> is not passed to <tt>emacsclient</tt> such that finishing your note or cancelling it leaves your desktop just as it was, but this will only work if you already have an already started <tt>emacsclient</tt>, as otherwise Emacs does not know which terminal type to use.

==== Setting up for PlannerMode ====

[new]
PlannerMode is somewhat obsoleted by OrgMode, specially since the latter is now included in Emacs (as of Emacs 23).

See http://www.asynchronous.org/blog/archives/2006/11/24/org-mode-vs-planner-mode for a comparison.
[new]
I wouldn't say it has been obsoleted by OrgMode, but that the two packages
address different users. -- JohnWiegley

[new]

Add this to your .emacs:

    (require 'remember-planner)
    (setq remember-handler-functions '(remember-planner-append))
    (setq remember-annotation-functions planner-annotation-functions)

According to Dryice Liu, "...if you are using FreeBSD, [the latest version of remember] is in the ports tree deskutils/remember.el"

One more thing.  Remember always puts notes on today's day page.  It does not prompt for a date.  If you'd like a note to appear on a different day's day page, use planner-timewarp to change PlannerMode's idea of what today's date is.  Be sure to change the date back when you're done!

== History ==

2008-04-16: Remember 2.0 released.  Remember is now included with Emacs as of Emacs 23.

2006-08-05: Remember is now group-maintained by Sacha Chua, Michael Olson, and John Sullivan.  Version 1.9 is released.

2006-05-01: "Remember" also works with the version of PlannerMode that's based on EmacsMuse.

2003-11-22: SachaChua now maintains remember.el. A new version (1.7) can be found on her site, together with updated versions of PlannerMode. The new version makes reverse-chronological timestamped entries easier, which means RememberMode + PlannerMode + EmacsWikiMode = blog
