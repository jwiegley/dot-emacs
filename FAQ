Q. I'm using Proof General for prover X, then I load a file for prover Y.
   The buffer doesn't enter the mode for prover Y.  Why not?

A. Unfortunately the architecture of Proof General is designed so
   that you can only use one prover at a time in the same Emacs
   session.   If you want to run more than one prover at a time,
   you have to run more than one Emacs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q. I have just installed Emacs, ProofGeneral and a proof assistant.
   It works but X-Symbol is not being activated.

A. Once X-Symbol is picked up by Emacs (e.g. is working for TeX), 
   you should enable it inside Proof General by the menu item:

     Proof-General -> Options -> X-Symbol
  
   To enable it automatically every time you use Proof General,
   type

        M-x customize-variable RET isar-x-symbol-enable RET

   and change/set/save the setting to `on'.  

   Note that we don't do this by default, because from the system's
   perspective it is difficult to determine if this will succeed ---
   or just produce funny characters that confuse new users even more.

   If you are using Isabelle, the wrapper script will load X-Symbol
   from any location, and you can enable it by passing the option 
   "-x true".

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q. I'm afraid I got stuck very early on.  I sent the following line:
      by (swap_res_tac [psubsetI] 1;
   Notice that I forgot the right bracket.  The line went pink, the
   buffer went read-only and nothing I tried would let me fix the
   error.  

A. The proof process is waiting for more input, but Proof General
   doesn't realise this and waits for a response.  You
   should type something in the proof shell, or interrupt the process
   with C-c C-c or the Stop button.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q. How can I keep the Proof General option settings across sessions?

A. Simply use the ordinary XEmacs menu: Options -> Save Options

   In GNU Emacs, you can do M-x customize-save-customized
   or use the Custom->Save menu in a customize buffer.

-----------------------------------------------------------------


Q. How do I use Proof General for Isabelle classic instead of Isabelle/Isar?

A. There are several ways:

   1. Use the Isabelle settings mechanism, invoke with "Isabelle"
   2. Set the environment variable PROOFGENERAL_ASSISTANTS=isa
      before starting Emacs.
   3. Put the line (* -*- isa -*- *) at the top of your files.

   Unfortunately Isabelle/Isar and Isabelle classic are two quite
   separate Proof General instances.  Ideally they should be
   combined into one, if anyone fancies some elisp hacking...


-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q. When using X-Symbol, why do I sometimes see funny characters like
   \233 in the buffer?

A. These are part of the 8 bit character codes used by X Symbol to
   get symbols from particular fonts.  Sometimes X-Symbol forgets to
   fontify the buffer properly to make it use the right fonts.
   (That's being rather unkind to X-Symbol: several things can 
    go wrong one way or another).

   To fix, type M-x font-lock-fontify-buffer or M-x x-symbol-fontify.
   If that doesn't work, type M-x font-lock-mode twice to turn
   font-lock off then on.  Or reload the file.
   
   Note that X-Symbol is more robust when used with XEmacs/Mule.

   Read the X-Symbol documentation for (much) more information.

Q. I would like to use the X-Symbol fonts in PG not just at the
   standard size but also for larger sizes since I use PG during
   talks, where I set the font size to 24.

A. Nobody has designed large versions of the X-Symbol fonts but it is
   possible to scale-up the existing ones, by adding

  (setq x-symbol-xsymb1-fonts
   '(("-xsymb-xsymb1-medium-r-normal-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-xsymb-xsymb1")
     ("-xsymb-xsymb1_sub-medium-r-normal-*-*-180-*-*-*-*-xsymb-xsymb1")
     ("-xsymb-xsymb1_sup-medium-r-normal-*-*-180-*-*-*-*-xsymb-xsymb1")))

  (setq x-symbol-xsymb0-fonts
    '(("-adobe-symbol-medium-r-normal-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-adobe-fontspecific"
       "-xsymb-xsymb0-medium-r-normal--*-240-75-75-p-85-adobe-fontspecific")
      ("-xsymb-xsymb0_sub-medium-r-normal--18-180-75-75-p-74-adobe-fontspecific"
       "-adobe-symbol_sub-medium-r-normal-*-*-180-*-*-*-*-adobe-fontspecific")
      ("-xsymb-xsymb0_sup-medium-r-normal--18-180-75-75-p-74-adobe-fontspecific"
       "-adobe-symbol_sup-medium-r-normal-*-*-180-*-*-*-*-adobe-fontspecific")))

   to your .emacs, which causes the special fonts to come up in size
   24; the normal font you can change manually. Of course you can also
   select smaller sizes. Most of the symbols look reasonable, except
   that they appear almost bold.
