-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q1. Proof General fails to load with an error message on start-up,
    containing text like this: 
  
       Proof General was compiled for GNU Emacs 22.1 but 
       running on XEmacs 21.5: please run "make clean; make"

    or

      error: "File `.../ProofGeneral/generic/proof-autoloads.elc' was 
      not compiled in Emacs"

    What's wrong?

A1. We distribute compiled .elcs for GNU Emacs 22.1, so you will have to
    delete them and (optionally) recompile for your preferred 
    Emacs version.  Using the Makefile:

     make clean			#   removes all .elc files.  

    and then a command like this:

     make EMACS=xemacs

    Note: GNU Emacs is recommended.  XEmacs support may be removed 
    in future.

   

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q2. Proof General fails to load with an error message like this: 

     file mode specification error: 
	(file-error "cannot open load file" "executable")

    What's wrong?

A2. You're missing some Emacs (probably XEmacs) packages.  See
    the section "Dependency on Other Emacs Packages" in INSTALL.
    Quicker answer: install the "XEmacs Sumo" package collection.



-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q2. Emacs appears to hang when the prover process is started.

A2. This is usually caused by UTF-8 support in recent linuxes with
    Glibc 2.2 or later, probably enabled with UTF8 encoded output in
    your default locale.  Unfortunately Proof General traditionally
    relied on 8-bit characters which are UTF8 prefixes in the output of
    proof assistants (inc Coq, Isabelle).  These prefix characters are
    not flushed to stdout individually.  As a workaround we can disable
    interpretation of UTF8 in the C libraries.

    Doing this inside PG/Emacs is unreliable; locale settings are
    set/inherited in strange ways.  One solution is to run the Emacs
    process itself with an altered locale setting, e.g., 

    $  LC_CTYPE=en_GB xemacs &

    (where $ is the shell prompt; this example is for my locale which
     by default is "en_GB.UTF-8": I see this by typing "locale" at
     the prompt).

    (This fix is attempted in the supplied "proofgeneral" script, as
     well as making an adjustment in Proof General when the string UTF
     appears in the current value of LC_CTYPE).

    Alternatively you can set LC_CTYPE inside a file ~/.i18n, which will
    be read the shell.  Put a line such as "LC_CTYPE=en_GB" into this file.
    However, this action will affect all applications.

    NB: a related issue is warnings from x-symbol: "Emacs language 
    environment and system locale specify different encoding, I'll 
    assume `iso-8859-1'".  This warning appears to be mostly harmless.
    Notice that the variable `buffer-file-coding-system' may determine
    the format that files are saved in.  

    Another way to affect this which has been suggested is to add a line
    like this to the init.el file on XEmacs:
  
      (prefer-coding-system 'ctext)

    but I haven't tried this.

    ** Update for PG 3.7 **

    The above fixes should not be necessary with most recent prover
    versions.  Isabelle 2007 has a "Unicode-safe" interaction mode,
    enabled by default (to disable, customise `proof-shell-unicode').
    This is also used by the Isabelle startup scripts.  Coq 8.1 and
    later do not use non-ASCII characters in output.

  

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q3. Help, I'm stuck!! Emacs keeps telling me "Cannot switch buffers in a
    dedicated window"  

A3. This can happen if you enabled "Use Three Panes" and then change
    the panes (window) layout manually, typically by deleting another 
    window or frame so you only have a "dedicated" window on the 
    display.  Don't kill Emacs!  There are many ways of getting out,
    e.g.
    -- In single window mode, C-c C-l (proof-layout-windows) refreshes
       the display

    -- In multiple window mode, if you have accidently deleted the main
       window, get a new one with M-x new-frame RET



-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q4. XEmacs displays a progress bar during fontification which
    sometimes gets stuck or messes up the display.  
    Is this a Proof General bug?  What can I do?

A4. This is an XEmacs issue.  You can prevent the use of the ugly
    widget, for example by adding

     (setq progress-feedback-use-echo-area t)

    inside your configuration file `.xemacs/init.el'.



-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q5. I have a problem installing/using Proof General, what can I do?

A5. Please check the documentation carefully, particularly the
    requirements for a full-featured and recent Emacs version, as
    mentioned in INSTALL (see "Dependency on Other Emacs Packages").  
    If you still cannot solve your problem, try to contact someone
    else who is using Proof General with a similar setup.  The
    best way to do this may be through the user mailing list for your
    proof assistant.  If you think the problem is Proof General related,
    consult the PG Wiki and Trac pages.



-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q6. I'm using Proof General for prover X, then I load a file for
    prover Y.  I get an error.  Why?

A6. Unfortunately the architecture of Proof General is designed so
    that you can only use one prover at a time in the same Emacs
    session.   If you want to run more than one prover at a time,
    you have to run more than one Emacs.



-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q7. I have just installed Emacs, ProofGeneral and a proof assistant.
    It works but X-Symbol is not being activated.

A7. Once X-Symbol is picked up by Emacs (e.g. is working for TeX), 
    you should enable it inside Proof General by the menu item:

      Proof-General -> Options -> X-Symbol
  
    To enable it automatically every time you use Proof General,
    type

         M-x customize-variable RET isar-x-symbol-enable RET
 
    and change/set/save the setting to `on'.  

    Note that we don't do this by default, because from the system's
    perspective it is difficult to determine if this will succeed ---
    or just produce funny characters that confuse new users even more.

    If you are using Isabelle, the wrapper script will load X-Symbol
    from any location, and you can enable it by passing the option 
    "-x true".


-----------------------------------------------------------------


Q8. I'm afraid I got stuck very early on.  I sent the following line:

      by (swap_res_tac [psubsetI] 1;

    Notice that I forgot the right bracket.  The line went pink, the
    buffer went read-only and nothing I tried would let me fix the
    error.  

A8. The proof process is waiting for more input because of the missing
    parenthesis, but Proof General doesn't realise this and waits for a
    response.  You should type something in the proof shell buffer
    (*isabelle*), or interrupt the process with C-c C-c or the Stop button.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q9. How can I keep the Proof General option settings across sessions?

A9. For options set in the Proof General -> Options menu use the 
    "Save Options" menu item (Proof General -> Options -> Save Options).

    For other options set via customize (Proof General -> Advanced -> 
    Customize), use the customize buttons, or M-x customize-save-customized.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q10. When using X-Symbol, why do I sometimes see funny characters like
    \233 in the buffer?

A10. These are part of the 8 bit character codes used by X Symbol to
     get symbols from particular fonts.  Sometimes X-Symbol forgets to
     fontify the buffer properly to make it use the right fonts.
     (That's being rather unkind to X-Symbol: several things can 
      go wrong one way or another).

     To fix, type 

  	M-x x-symbol-decode-recode

     If that doesn't work, type M-x font-lock-mode twice to turn
     font-lock off then on.  Or reload the file.
     
     Read the X-Symbol documentation for (much) more information.
     http://x-symbol.sourceforge.net/man/


-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q11. I would like to use the X-Symbol fonts in PG not just at the
     standard size but also for larger sizes since I use PG during
     talks, where I set the font size to 24.

A11. There are X-Symbol fonts at sizes of 12, 14, 18 and 24.  The
     standard size is 14, and 12 is used for subscripts.  The font size
     can be changed by adding

	(setq x-symbol-font-sizes '(("" 24 18)))

     to your .emacs, which causes the special fonts to come up in size
     24 and 18 for subscripts; the normal font can be changed
     manually.  By choosing other sizes, it is also possible to scale
     the existing fonts.  Note that the larger fonts are not perfect.

     If you use Isabelle (both isa or isar) you can specify the
     X-Symbol font size through the -f option of the start-up-script.
     The size is passed to emacs through the environment variable
     XSYMBOL_FONTSIZE, which can be used to configure the normal font in
     your .emacs.

     You can also use X-Symbol with scalable fonts rather than
     the default bitmaps.  This is the mechanism used for Mac and
     would work for GNU Emacs >=23 versions, but there isn't yet
     a way to configure this automatically.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q12. The "Favourites" feature to insert/send fixed strings is great, 
     but I'd like to define a command which takes arguments.

A12. You can do that in Elisp with a command like this: 

      (proof-definvisible isar-theorem
        '(format "thm %s" (read-string "theorem: "))
         [(control t)])

     (NB: it binds the key C-c C-a C-t).  See the documentation for
     `proof-definvisible' and `proof-defshortcut`.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q13. Why do I get a warning "Bad version of xml.el found, ..."?

A13. Your Emacs distribution includes a version of xml.el which has 
     fundamental bugs.   The patched version of xml.el, in lib/xml-fixed.el
     has been loaded instead.  This works for Proof General because it fixes
     the basic bugs, but it may cause compatibility issues in other packages
     (e.g. it is quite different from the latest xml.el with GNU Emacs
     development versions).
   
     This message is probably nothing to worry about unless you are using
     the same Emacs session for other packages that heavily use xml.el
     (e.g. GNUS).


-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q14. I see spurious ^M characters at the end of lines in the 
     windows showing output from the prover.  How can I remove
     them?

A14. Customize the value of `proof-shell-strip-crs-from-output'.



-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q15. Undo behaviour in Coq seems to stop working with very long
     sequences of commands.

A15. Coq has a limited history for Undo.  Change 

	Coq -> Settings -> Undo Depth

     to something higher.  


-----------------------------------------------------------------


Q16. Can I join any mailing lists for Proof General?

A16. Of course, email "proofgeneral-request@informatics.ed.ac.uk" 
     with the line "subscribe" in the message body, to join the
     users' and announcements list.

     There is also a list for developers, proofgeneral-devel:
