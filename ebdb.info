1 Getting Started
*****************

Assuming you have no records you want to migrate from other contact
management software, it is enough to call the top-level ‘ebdb’ command.
This will create a new database at the location specified by
‘ebdb-sources’ (see *note The EBDB Database::), prompt you for a search
string, fail to find anything (because you don’t have any records yet),
and finally open a *EBDB* buffer where you can start to make new records
(see *note Creating Records::).

* Menu:

* Migration from BBDB::
* Migration from Org Contacts::

1.1 Migration from BBDB
=======================

* Menu:

* Record Migration::
* Variables and Options::


File: ebdb.info,  Node: Record Migration,  Next: Variables and Options,  Up: Migration from BBDB

1.1.1 Record Migration
----------------------

It’s possible to migrate records from a BBDB database.  The ‘bbdb-file’
variable should point to your current BBDB file; alternately EBDB will
look in the default location, found using ‘(locate-user-emacs-file
"bbdb" ".bbdb)’.  Then set ‘ebdb-sources’ to a non-existent file name,
and then run ‘ebdb-load’ (or any of the other EBDB entry commands).
You’ll be prompted to create the new database, and upgrade from BBDB. If
any records could not be upgraded, they will be displayed in an *EBDB
Migration Errors* buffer.  Migration bug reports are very welcome.

   You can also call the command ‘ebdb-migrate-from-bbdb’ at any time.


File: ebdb.info,  Node: Variables and Options,  Prev: Record Migration,  Up: Migration from BBDB

1.1.2 Variables and Options
---------------------------

Many of the old BBDB customization options have been changed or removed
entirely in EBDB. It’s probably best to put your BBDB customizations
aside, and set new EBDB options as you come across them.  The most
important options are detailed in this manual, you can also customize
the “EBDB” group to see what’s available.


File: ebdb.info,  Node: Migration from Org Contacts,  Prev: Migration from BBDB,  Up: Getting Started

1.2 Migration from Org Contacts
===============================

EBDB also provides limited support for migrating from Org Contacts:
simply call the command ‘ebdb-migrate-from-org-contacts’.  Your contacts
database will be scanned, and all contacts will be migrated.  Any field
values that could not be migrated will be displayed in a *EBDB Migration
Errors* buffer.

   At present, addresses cannot be migrated automatically.  Org Contacts
stores addresses as a free-form string, which is simply too difficult to
parse accurately.  Address values will be inserted into the migration
errors buffer, and will have to be added to the records manually.


File: ebdb.info,  Node: The EBDB Database,  Next: Creating Records,  Prev: Getting Started,  Up: Top

2 The EBDB Database
*******************

EBDB supports multiple databases, and each database definition is saved
in a file on disk.  The default database class, ‘ebdb-db-file’, stores
its contacts in the same file as the database itself, though other
database classes may store contacts elsewhere.

 -- User Option: ebdb-sources
     User option specifying one or more databases to load.  It can be a
     single element, or a list of elements.  Each element can be a
     filename, from which a database is loaded, or it can be an instance
     of a subclass of the ‘ebdb-db’ class.  The database at the head of
     the list will be considered the default database.

   Databases have a few user-facing settings:

 -- Instance Variable of Database: ‘boolean’ read-only
     If non-nil, records can only be read from the database, not edited
     or deleted.

 -- Instance Variable of Database: ‘boolean’ auto-save
     If non-nil, the database’s records will not be autosaved.

 -- Instance Variable of Database: ‘character’ buffer-char
     A single character that will be displayed next to records in the
     *EBDB* buffer, indicating which database they belong to.

 -- Instance Variable of Database: ‘boolean’ disabled
     When non-nil , the database will essentially be ignored—no records
     will be read from it.  Setting this to t will only take effect on
     next restart; to disable a database immediately, use
     ‘ebdb-disable-database’ below.

 -- Instance Variable of Database: ‘symbol’ record-class
     The default record class to use when creating new records in this
     database.  The default is ‘ebdb-default-record-class’.

   While it’s possible to edit database definitions directly in the
file, it’s safer to use the customization interface to do so from the
*EBDB* buffer.

‘d e’
     Use the customize interface to edit the definition of a database
     (‘ebdb-customize-database’).

   Records can be moved or copied from one database to another.  It’s
also possible for a single record to live in more than one database,
though this functionality is experimental.  When a record is loaded from
more than one database, the two copies are compared using the timestamp
field, and the older copy is discarded.  In an *EBDB* buffer, the
following keys can be used to manipulate databases and their records.

‘d m’
     Move a record from its current database to another
     (‘ebdb-move-record’).

‘d c’
     Copy a record into a new database, leaving it in its existing
     database(s) (‘ebdb-copy-record’).

   Other database-related commands:

‘d r’
     Reload all records from a database.  This also redisplays any of
     those records that were visible in *EBDB* buffers
     (‘ebdb-reload-database’).

‘d d’
     This command (‘ebdb-disable-database’) disables a database,
     unloading all of its records and essentially ignoring it from now
     on.  The disabled state persists between restarts.  To re-enable a
     database, edit it using ‘ebdb-customize-database’, set ‘disabled’
     to nil, and then reload it with ‘ebdb-reload-database’.

   Typically, databases are saved using the ‘s’ binding in ‘ebdb-mode’
buffers, which runs ‘ebdb-save’.  By default, EBDB also installs
‘ebdb-save’ as part of the ‘kill-emacs-hook’, so that the EBDB is
automatically saved before Emacs exit.  Set ‘ebdb-save-on-exit’ to nil
to prevent this.

   Loading and initializing the EBDB can be slow for large databases.
If you find yourself annoyed by the wait, try setting
‘ebdb-try-speedups’ to non-nil.  This will disable some checks performed
during the object creation process, which theoretically shouldn’t make a
difference.  If something does go wrong at load-time, however, try
setting this back to ‘nil’ first.


File: ebdb.info,  Node: Creating Records,  Next: Record Fields,  Prev: The EBDB Database,  Up: Top

3 Creating Records
******************

Create a record using ‘c’ (‘ebdb-create-record’) in the *EBDB* buffer.
This command will create an instance of the default record class, in the
database at the head of ‘ebdb-sources’.

 -- User Option: ebdb-default-record-class
     The default record class to use when creating new records.
     Defaults to ‘ebdb-record-person’.

   Alternately create a record using ‘C’
(‘ebdb-create-record-extended’), which will prompt for a record class to
use, as well as a database to store the record in, if there is more than
one.

   You can also tell EBDB which record represents you:

 -- User Option: ebdb-record-self
     The value of this option should be the UUID of your own record.
     You can find this by pressing ‘T’ (to show all fields) on your
     record.

   Currently this option’s only use is to serve as a source for
‘ebdb-user-mail-address-re’.

* Menu:

* Record classes::
* Record names::


File: ebdb.info,  Node: Record classes,  Next: Record names,  Up: Creating Records

3.1 Record classes
==================

EBDB comes with two record classes, representing individuals
(‘ebdb-record-person’) and organizations (‘ebdb-record-organization’).
Records can have “roles” at organizations, *note Role Fields: Role
fields.


File: ebdb.info,  Node: Record names,  Prev: Record classes,  Up: Creating Records

3.2 Record names
================

EBDB comes with two classes for name fields: “simple” and “complex”.
Simple names are just a single string, complex names are split out into
surname, given names, suffix, etc.  All records have a single canonical
name: person records have a complex name, organization records have a
simple name.

   In addition, person records can have one or more “aka” names, and
these akas can be either simple or complex.  When adding fields to a
record, the simple name class is labeled “nickname”, and the complex
class is labeled “alt name”.

4 Record Fields
***************

* Menu:

* Inserting New Fields::
* Editing Existing Fields::
* Deleting Records and Fields::
* Field Types::


File: ebdb.info,  Node: Inserting New Fields,  Next: Editing Existing Fields,  Up: Record Fields

4.1 Inserting New Fields
========================

Pressing ‘i’ (‘ebdb-insert-field’) with point on a record will prompt
for a field type, then field values, and add the field to the record.
See below for more information about the various kinds of fields.

   When entering field data, optional data can be skipped by entering a
blank string, or by pressing ‘C-g’.  The first ‘C-g’ will cancel the
current data prompt; the second ‘C-g’ will cancel the creation of the
field altogether.  For instance, when creating address fields, EBDB will
allow you to create an arbitrary number of street lines.  When you’ve
added enough, either enter a blank string, or hit ‘C-g’.


File: ebdb.info,  Node: Editing Existing Fields,  Next: Deleting Records and Fields,  Prev: Inserting New Fields,  Up: Record Fields

4.2 Editing Existing Fields
===========================

Pressing ‘e’ (‘ebdb-edit-field’) with point on a field will allow you to
edit an existing field, with the previous values as defaults.

   Alternately, press ‘E’ (‘ebdb-edit-field-customize’) to edit the
field’s values using the Customize interface.  Some fields have slots
that can only be edited this way; other fields have slots that cannot be
edited at all once the field is created.


File: ebdb.info,  Node: Deleting Records and Fields,  Next: Field Types,  Prev: Editing Existing Fields,  Up: Record Fields

4.3 Deleting Records and Fields
===============================

Pressing ‘C-k’ on a field will ask you for confirmation, then delete the
field.  Pressing ‘C-k’ while point is on or before a record’s main name
will instead prompt to delete the whole record.


File: ebdb.info,  Node: Field Types,  Prev: Deleting Records and Fields,  Up: Record Fields

4.4 Field Types
===============

Fields can be classed in a few different categories.  Some are
“plumbing” fields, that are present for all records, but not generally
visible or user-editable: these include the creation date, timestamp,
and UUID. You can view these fields by hitting ‘T’ on the record.  Other
fields are “built-in”: basic fields that get special treatment.  These
include the name, mail, phone, address, and notes fields.  EBDB comes
with default classes for these fields: if you would like to use
different defaults, you can create new classes (inheriting from the
existing ones) and use those instead.  See *note Hacking EBDB:: for more
information.

   Besides the “plumbing” and “built-in” fields, all other fields are
referred to as “user” fields.  These can hold any kind of information
you want to associate with a record.  Some user fields are simple string
keys and string values; others have more complicated data structures and
behavior.

   When adding a field to a record, you’ll be prompted for a field type.
The list will include the built-in fields, more complicated field types,
and also all the simple string keys you’ve defined so far.  If you enter
a string key that EBDB hasn’t seen before, it will prompt for
confirmation, then define that key for future use.

   EBDB comes with more complicated classes including “anniversary”,
“url”, “id”, “relation”, “role” and more.  Many of these fields have
their own list of labels: for instance, anniversary fields may be
labeled “birthday” or “wedding”, and URL fields might be labeled
“homepage” or “file-sharing”.

   In the case of fields with labels, you’ll first choose the general
field (“anniversary”), then enter the field data, and lastly choose a
label (“birthday”).  Again, if you choose a label that hasn’t been seen
before, EBDB will first prompt for confirmation, then define the label
for future use.  You can also enter an empty string or hit ‘C-g’ to omit
the label altogether.

   Loading secondary libraries may make more field types available.

* Menu:

* Role fields::
* Tag field::
* Mail folder field::


File: ebdb.info,  Node: Role fields,  Next: Tag field,  Up: Field Types

4.4.1 Role fields
-----------------

One type of field worth mentioning in particular is the role field.
EBDB records come in two types at present: person and organization.
People have roles at organizations: jobs, volunteer positions, etc.
People are also likely to have roles at more than one organization.

   When adding a role field to a record, you’ll be prompted for a string
label denoting eg. a job title, prompted for an organization, and
prompted for a mail address that belongs only to this role field (ie. an
institutional email address).  If the organization has a “domain” field
type, and the person has an existing mail address that matches that
domain, you’ll be prompted to move that address to the role field.

   When viewing organization records, the role fields for all related
person records are also displayed as part of the organization record.

   If a person’s role at an organization later comes to an end, the role
field can be deleted, or marked as “defunct”, if record keeping is
desired.  This can only be done using the customize-based editing
interface (the ‘E’ key on the role field).

   In fact, in addition to a mail field, role fields can contain an
arbitrary number of other fields, representing metadata about the role
(an employee number, employment start date, etc).  The author has yet to
come up with a good interface for viewing and manipulating these extra
fields, however, so the functionality remains hidden.  Suggestions are
very welcome.

   Manipulating role fields is generally a little clunky, at present.
This will be addressed in future.


File: ebdb.info,  Node: Tag field,  Next: Mail folder field,  Prev: Role fields,  Up: Field Types

4.4.2 Tag field
---------------

EBDB comes with a field holding arbitrary tags for records.  When
searching on the tags field (using ‘/ x’ and selecting “tags”), EBDB
provides the same tag search syntax as Org does, eg.
“work|laptop+night”.  *Note (org)Matching tags and properties:: for more
information.

   The ‘ebdb-org’ library comes with another tagging class,
‘ebdb-org-field-tags’, that behaves just like the standard class, except
the user’s Org-file tags are offered for completion.  *note Org
Integration::.


File: ebdb.info,  Node: Mail folder field,  Prev: Tag field,  Up: Field Types

4.4.3 Mail folder field
-----------------------

The “mail folder” field is used to indicate which folder or group
incoming mail from the contact should be filed into.  Currently only
Gnus supports this; support in other MUAs is forthcoming.


File: ebdb.info,  Node: MUA Interaction,  Next: EBDB Buffers,  Prev: Record Fields,  Up: Top

5 MUA Interaction
*****************

One of EBDB’s most important features is the ability to create, update
and display records based on messages received or sent in your mail user
agent(s).  In theory, EBDB can be integrated with any software package,
but it’s most common to use it in conjunction with sending and receiving
emails.

* Menu:

* Loading MUA Code::
* Display and Updating::
* EBDB and MUA summary buffers::


File: ebdb.info,  Node: Loading MUA Code,  Next: Display and Updating,  Up: MUA Interaction

5.1 Loading MUA Code
====================

MUA code is activated simply by loading the relevant library.  Keep in
mind that mail-reading clients and mail-sending clients are considered
separate MUAs.  For instance, if you use the Gnus package for reading
mail, and Message for sending it, you’ll want two require statements:

     (require 'ebdb-gnus)
     (require 'ebdb-message)

   There are other packages that provide other MUA integration: these
are likewise activated simply by requiring the relevant library, named
“ebdb-<MUA>”.  MUAs supported by EBDB include gnus, message, mh-e, mu4e,
wl, and rmail.


File: ebdb.info,  Node: Display and Updating,  Next: EBDB and MUA summary buffers,  Prev: Loading MUA Code,  Up: MUA Interaction

5.2 Display and Updating
========================

When a message is opened in an MUA, EBDB can do certain things with the
records referenced in that message.  It can:

   • Pop up a buffer displaying the records.
   • Create new records, or alter existing records, based on information
     provided by the MUA.
   • Run automatic rules to edit the records.
   • Provide keybindings to manually edit the records.

   Each of these functionalities is optional, and can be customized
independently of the others.

* Menu:

* Pop-up Buffers::
* Auto-Updating Records::
* Noticing and Automatic Rules::
* Interactive Commands::


File: ebdb.info,  Node: Pop-up Buffers,  Next: Auto-Updating Records,  Up: Display and Updating

5.2.1 Pop-up Buffers
--------------------

Each MUA creates its own EBDB pop-up buffer, with a name like
*EBDB-Gnus* or *EBDB-Rmail*.  MUAs will re-use their own buffers, and
will not interfere with buffers the user has created using the ‘ebdb’
command, or by cloning or renaming existing buffers.

 -- User Option: ebdb-mua-pop-up
     If nil, MUAs will not automatically pop up buffers.  It is still
     possible to manually create the buffer using interactive commands
     (see below).

   EBDB can also integrate with atomic windows (*Note (elisp)Atomic
Windows::).

 -- User Option: ebdb-join-atomic-windows
     When non-nil (the defaul), EBDB buffers that are popped up within
     existing atomic windows will become part of the atomic buffer.
     Otherwise they will be opened to one side of the atomic window.

   At present, there are _no_ other user customization options
controlling the size and layout of MUA pop-up buffers: each MUA creates
the pop-up according to hard-coded rules.  This will likely change in
the future: please complain to the author.


File: ebdb.info,  Node: Auto-Updating Records,  Next: Noticing and Automatic Rules,  Prev: Pop-up Buffers,  Up: Display and Updating

5.2.2 Auto-Updating Records
---------------------------

EBDB can automatically update the name and mail addresses of records
based on information in an MUA message.  The first and most important
option governing this behavior is:

 -- User Option: ebdb-mua-auto-update-p
     This option determines how EBDB acts upon mail addresses found in
     incoming messages.  If nil, nothing will happen.  Other options
     include the symbols ‘update’ (only find existing records, and
     update their name and mail fields as necessary), ‘query’ (find
     existing records, and query about the editing and creation of new
     records), and ‘create’ (automatically create new records).  A value
     of ‘t’ is considered equivalent to ‘create’.  The option can also
     be set to a function which returns one of the above symbols.

   This option only governs what EBDB does automatically, each time a
message is displayed.  The same process can be run interactively using
the commands below.  When updating records either automatically or
interactively, a few more options come into play:

 -- User Option: ebdb-add-name
     Whether to automatically change record names.  See docstring for
     details.

 -- User Option: ebdb-add-aka
     Whether to automatically add new names as akas.  See docstring for
     details.

 -- User Option: ebdb-add-mails
     How to handle apparently new mail addresses.  See docstring for
     details.

   There are also options governing whether EBDB will consider a mail
address or not:

 -- User Option: ebdb-accept-header-list
     An alist governing which addresses in which headers will be
     accepted.  See docstring for details.

 -- User Option: ebdb-ignore-header-list
     An alist governing which addresses in which headers will be
     ignored.  See docstring for details.

 -- User Option: ebdb-user-name-address-re
     A regular expression matching the user’s own mail address(es).  In
     addition to a regexp, this can also be the symbol ‘message’, in
     which case the value will be copied from
     ‘message-alternative-emails’, or the symbol ‘self’, in which case
     the value will be constructed from the record pointed to by the
     option ‘ebdb-record-self’.


File: ebdb.info,  Node: Noticing and Automatic Rules,  Next: Interactive Commands,  Prev: Auto-Updating Records,  Up: Display and Updating

5.2.3 Noticing and Automatic Rules
----------------------------------

In addition to updating records’ name and mail fields, it’s possible to
run other arbitrary edits on records when they are referenced in a
message.  This process is called “noticing”.  Two hooks are run as a
part of noticing:

 -- User Option: ebdb-notice-record-hook
     This hook is run once per record noticed, with two arguments: the
     record, and one of the symbols ‘sender’ and ‘recipient’, indicating
     where in the message headers the record was found.

 -- User Option: ebdb-notice-mail-hook
     This hook is run once per mail message noticed: if multiple
     addresses belong to a single record, it will be called once per
     address.  The hook is run with one argument: the record.

   When a record is noticed, it will also call the method
‘ebdb-notice-field’ on all of its fields.  Using this method requires a
bit of familiarity with *note (elisp)Generic Functions::; suffice it to
say that the first argument is the field instance being noticed, the
second argument is one of the symbols ‘sender’ or ‘recipient’, and the
third argument is the record being noticed.


File: ebdb.info,  Node: Interactive Commands,  Prev: Noticing and Automatic Rules,  Up: Display and Updating

5.2.4 Interactive Commands
--------------------------

Some interactive commands are also provided for operating on the
relevant EBDB records.  In message-reading MUAs, EBDB creates its own
keymap, and binds it to the key “;”.  The following list assumes this
binding, and only specifies the further binding.  Ie, press “;:” to call
‘ebdb-mua-display-records’.

‘:’
     If the option ‘ebdb-mua-auto-update-p’ is nil, this command
     (‘ebdb-mua-update-records’) can be used to do the same thing, and
     will behave as if that option were set to ‘query’.

‘;’
     If the option ‘ebdb-mua-pop-up’ is nil, this command can be used to
     do the same thing (‘ebdb-mua-display-all-records’).

‘'’
     Edit the notes field of the message sender
     (‘ebdb-mua-edit-sender-notes’).

‘”’
     This command moves point to the relevant EBDB pop-up buffer
     (popping the buffer up first, if necessary).  You can then issue
     commands in the EBDB buffer as usual, with the exception that ‘q’
     will move point back to the previously-selected window, rather than
     quitting the EBDB buffer.

‘s’
     This command scans the body text of the current message, and
     attempts to snarf new record information from it.  Email addresses
     and names in the body text will be handled, as will information in
     the headers of forwarded mail, and information in the signature
     will be associated with the sender.  The user is always prompted
     before edits are made.  This functionality is highly unreliable,
     and probably won’t work as advertised.

‘t’
     This command toggles the displayed records between the multiline
     and oneline display formats.

   Other command are not bound by default:

 -- Command: ebdb-mua-yank-cc
     Prompt for an existing *EBDB* buffer, and add addresses for all the
     records displayed there to the “CC:” line of the message being
     composed.  This command is not bound by default, because the EBDB
     keymap is not bound by default in message composition MUAs.

 -- Command: ebdb-mua-display-sender
     Only display the sender.

 -- Command: ebdb-mua-display-recipients
     Only display the recipients.

 -- Command: ebdb-mua-display-all-recipients
     Only display recipients, using all mail addresses from the message.

5.3 EBDB and MUA summary buffers
================================

EBDB can affect the way message senders are displayed in your MUA’s
summary buffer.  It can do this in two ways: 1) by changing the way the
contact name is displayed, and 2) by optionally displaying a
one-character mark next to the contact’s name.

* Menu:

* Sender name display::
* Summary buffer marks::


File: ebdb.info,  Node: Sender name display,  Next: Summary buffer marks,  Up: EBDB and MUA summary buffers

5.3.1 Sender name display
-------------------------

EBDB can “unify” the name displayed for a sender that exists in the
database.  In general, an MUA will display the name part of the From:
header in the mailbox summary buffer.  EBDB can replace that display
name with information from the database.  This only works for Gnus,
which allows for overriding how message senders are displayed.  The
format letter (see below) should be added to ‘gnus-summary-line-format’
for Gnus (which see).

 -- User Option: ebdb-message-clean-name-function
     A function used to clean up the name extracted from the headers of
     a message.

 -- User Option: ebdb-message-mail-as-name
     If non-nil, the mail address will be used as a fallback for new
     record names.

 -- User Option: ebdb-mua-summary-unification-list
     A list of fields used by ‘ebdb-mua-summary-unify’ to return a value
     for unification.  See docstring for details.

 -- User Option: ebdb-mua-summary-unify-format-letter
     Format letter to use for the EBDB-unified sender name in a Gnus
     summary buffer.  Defaults to “E”.

5.3.2 Summary buffer marks
--------------------------

EBDB can display a one-character mark next to the name of senders that
are in the database—at present this is only possible in the Gnus and VM
MUAs.  This can be done in one of three ways.  From most general to most
specific:

 -- User Option: ebdb-mua-summary-mark
     Set to a single-character string to use for all senders in the EBDB
     database.  Set to nil to not mark senders at all.

 -- Method on ebdb-record: ebdb-mua-make-summary-mark record
     This generic function accepts RECORD as a single argument, and
     returns a single-character string to be used as a mark.

   Alternately, give a record an instance of the “summary mark” field
class to use that specific mark for that record.

   Marks are displayed in MUA summary buffers by customizing the format
string provided by Gnus, and adding the EBDB-specific format code:

 -- User Option: ebdb-mua-summary-mark-format-letter
     Format letter to use in the summary buffer format string to mark a
     record.  Defaults to “e”.

6 EBDB Buffers
**************

EBDB can create several separate buffers for displaying contacts.
Typically, each MUA creates its own buffer, with names like *EBDB-Gnus*,
etc.  Users can also create their own buffers that won’t be interfered
with by MUA pop-up action.  Calling the ‘ebdb’ command directly will
create such a “user-owned” buffer; it’s also possible to create more by
using the ‘ebdb-clone-buffer’ and ‘ebdb-rename-buffer’ commands within
existing EBDB buffers.

 -- User Option: ebdb-buffer-name
     The base string that is used to create EBDB buffers, without
     asterisks.  Defaults to “EBDB”.

‘b c’
     Prompt for a buffer name, and create a new EBDB buffer displaying
     the same records as the original buffer (‘ebdb-clone-buffer’).

‘b r’
     Rename the current EBDB buffer (‘ebdb-rename-buffer’).  If this is
     done in a MUA pop-up buffer, the original buffer will be recreated
     next time the MUA requests another pop up.

6.1 Searching
=============

The most general search is performed with ‘/ /’, which searches on many
different record fields and displays the results.

   The EBDB major mode provides many keys for searching on specific
record fields.  Most of these keys are used after one of three prefix
keys, which change the behavior of the search: ‘/’ clears the buffer
before displaying the results, ‘|’ searches only among the records
already displayed, and ‘+’ appends the search results to the records
already displayed.

   For instance, record name search is on the key ‘n’, meaning you can
use ‘/ n’, ‘| n’, or ‘+ n’.  Search keys that work this way are:

‘n’
     Search names
‘o’
     Search organizations
‘p’
     Search phones
‘a’
     Search addresses
‘m’
     Search mails
‘x’
     Search user fields (prompts for which field to search on)
‘c’
     Search records that have been modified since last save
‘C’
     Search by record class
‘D’
     Prompt for a database and display all records belonging to that
     database

   Search commands that currently only work with the ‘/’ prefix are:

‘/ 1’
     Prompt for a single record, and display it
‘/ d’
     Search duplicate records

   Searches can be inverted:

‘!’
     Invert the results of the next search (‘ebdb-search-invert’).

   Each user-created *EBDB* buffer keeps track of search history in that
buffer.  To pop back to previous searches, use:

‘^’
     ‘ebdb-search-pop’

* Menu:

* Changing Search Behavior::


File: ebdb.info,  Node: Changing Search Behavior,  Up: Searching

6.1.1 Changing Search Behavior
------------------------------

There are three ways to alter the behavior of EBDB searches.

 -- User Option: ebdb-case-fold-search
     An equivalent to the regular ‘case-fold-search’ variable, which
     see.  Defaults to the value of that variable.

 -- User Option: ebdb-char-fold-search
     Controls whether character folding is used when matching search
     strings against record values.

 -- User Option: ebdb-search-transform-functions
     A list of functions that can be used to arbitrarily transform
     search strings.  Each function should accept a single string
     argument, and return the transformed string.  If the search
     criterion is not a string (some fields produce sexp search
     criteria) these functions will not be used.

   Be careful of potential interaction between character folding and
transform functions.  Character folding works by calling
‘char-fold-to-regexp’ on the search string, effectively replacing
foldable characters within the string using regular expressions.  This
process happens _after_ the transform functions have run, so there is a
possibility for unexpected search behavior.

6.2 The Basics of ebdb-mode
===========================

EBDB buffers inherit from special-mode, and so the usual special-mode
keybindings apply.

‘n’
     Move point to the next record (‘ebdb-next-record’).

‘p’
     Move point to the previous record (‘ebdb-prev-record’).

‘N’
     Move point to the next field (‘ebdb-next-field’).

‘P’
     Move point to the previous field (‘ebdb-prev-field’).

‘c’
     Create a new person record in the primary database
     (‘ebdb-create-record’).

‘C’
     Prompt for database and record class, then create a new record
     (‘ebdb-create-record-extended’).

‘i’
     Insert a new field into the record under point, or the marked
     records (‘ebdb-insert-field’).

‘e’
     Edit the field under point (‘ebdb-edit-field’).

‘E’
     Use the extended customize interface to edit the field under point
     (‘ebdb-edit-field-customize’).

‘;’
     Either insert/edit the record’s notes field or, with a prefix arg,
     prompt for an existing field and edit it (‘ebdb-edit-foo’).

‘C-k’
     With point on a record field, offer to delete that field.  With
     point on a record header, offer to delete the whole record.
     (‘ebdb-delete-field-or-record’)

‘<RET>’
     Run an “action” on the field under point (‘ebdb-record-action’).
     If multiple actions are provided, you’ll be prompted to choose one.
     Not all fields provide actions.  ‘<RET>’ on a mail field will
     compose a message to that mail address

‘m’
     Begin composing a message to the record under point (‘ebdb-mail’).
     With a prefix arg, prompt for the mail address to use; otherwise
     use the record’s primary address.

‘t’
     Toggle between a multi-line and one-line display
     (‘ebdb-toggle-records-format’).

‘T’
     Display all of a record’s fields
     (‘ebdb-display-records-completely’).

‘r’
     Redisplay the record under point (‘ebdb-reformat-records’).

‘o’
     Remove the record under point (or marked records) from the buffer
     (does not delete the records) (‘ebdb-omit-records’).

‘I’
     Put a “citation” for the record under point (or marked records)
     onto the kill ring (‘ebdb-cite-records-ebdb’).  A “citation” is a
     name-and-mail string for the record.  Prompt for a style, meaning a
     textual mode.  With a prefix arg, arrange citations in a list,
     otherwise inline.

‘w f’

     Copy the string value of the field under point to the kill ring
     (‘ebdb-copy-fields-as-kill’).

‘w r’
     Copy a string representation of the whole record under point to the
     kill ring (‘ebdb-copy-records-as-kill’).

‘w m’
     Copy a name-plus-mail string citation for the record under point to
     the kill ring (‘ebdb-copy-mail-as-kill’).  These strings look like
     “John Q Public <john@public.com>”.  By default this will use the
     record’s primary address; supply a prefix arg to be prompted for
     which address to use.

‘g’
     Redisplay all visible records (‘revert-buffer’).

‘?’
     Show a very brief help message (‘ebdb-help’).

‘h’
     Open this manual (‘ebdb-info’).

‘s’
     Save all databases (‘ebdb-save’).

‘q’
     Delete the *EBDB* window (‘quit-window’).

creation and field manipulation.

6.3 Marking
===========

Records can be marked and acted on in bulk.  The ‘#’ key will toggle the
mark of the record under point.  ‘M-#’ will toggle the marks of all the
records in the buffer, and ‘C-#’ unmarks all records in the buffer.
Many editing commands can act on multiple marked records.


File: ebdb.info,  Node: Exporting/Formatting,  Prev: Marking,  Up: EBDB Buffers

6.4 Exporting/Formatting
========================

It is possible to export (referred to as “formatting”) records in
various ways.  The most common export format is that of the *EBDB*
buffers themselves, but other formats are possible.

   At present, the only other supported format is VCard, and support is
imperfect: not all fields can be exported correctly.  VCard version 2.1
is unsupported: the only options are version 3.0 and 4.0.

‘f’
     This command prompts for a formatter, and formats the record under
     point to a temporary buffer (‘ebdb-format-to-tmp-buffer’).  Use
     *note marking: Marking. to format multiple records.

‘F’
     Export all records in the database (not only those displayed) to a
     different format (‘ebdb-format-all-records’).

   It’s possible to write new formatters, documentation is forthcoming.

7 Completion
************

There are many Emacs completion frameworks out there, and libraries
exist providing EBDB support for helm, counsel, and company.  These
libraries must be loaded from the package repositories, and provide the
commands ‘helm-ebdb’, ‘counsel-ebdb’, and ‘company-ebdb’, respectively.
Counsel and company are made to be hooked into Emacs’ existing
completion frameworks; the helm command must be called explicitly.

   Another built-in library, ‘ebdb-complete’, uses an ephemeral pop-up
*EBDB* buffer for record completion.  The command ‘ebdb-complete’
provides an interactive entry point, or you can enable it for ‘<TAB>’ in
‘message-mode’ by calling ‘ebdb-complete-enable’.

   Several native EBDB commands involve choosing a record, or multiple
records.  At present, the completion interface for these commands is a
bit random: several of the commands simply use ‘completing-read’
directly, which isn’t right.  At some point, all EBDB commands that ask
the user to select a record will become aware of the currently-loaded
completion frameworks.

8 Snarfing
**********

“Snarfing” refers to scanning free-form text and extracting information
related to EBDB records from it.  For example, calling ‘ebdb-snarf’
while the region contains the text “John Doe <j.doe@email.com>” will
find an existing contact or prompt to create a new one, and then display
that contact.

   Snarfing is a work in progress: at present, only mail addresses, URLs
and nearby names are acted upon, and it often doesn’t work correctly.

 -- Command: ebdb-snarf &optional string start end recs
     Extract record-related information from a piece of text.  Find,
     update, or create records as necessary, and then display them.
     When the region is active, this command snarfs the current region,
     otherwise it snarfs the entire current buffer.  Called as a
     function, it can accept a string as the first argument and snarfs
     that.  The RECS argument, which cannot be passed interactively, is
     a list of records that are assumed to be related to snarfable data
     in STRING.

 -- User Option: ebdb-snarf-routines
     An alist of field class symbols and related regexps.  The regexps
     are used to collect text that is likely parseable by the
     ‘ebdb-parse’ method of the field class.

 -- User Option: ebdb-snarf-name-re
     A list of regular expressions used to recognize names for a snarfed
     contact.  Searching names directly is mostly impossible, so names
     are only looked for in close proximity to other field data.

   In MUAs, EBDB can also snarf the body of the article being displayed.
This is separate from the updating process, which only examines the
article headers.

 -- User Option: Command ebdb-mua-snarf-article &optional arg
     Snarf the body of the current article.  This will also snarf the
     headers of forwarded emails, and the signature.  With a prefix
     argument, only snarf the signature.

9 Internationalization
**********************

EBDB comes with an internationalization framework that can provide
country- and region-specific behavior for certain fields.  This
functionality is initialized by loading the ‘ebdb-i18n’ library.  This
library does nothing by itself, it simply provides hooks for other
country-specific libraries.

   Country libraries that do not depend on other external libraries may
live within the EBDB codebase, in which case they will be loaded
automatically when ‘ebdb-i18n’ is loaded.  Libraries with external
dependencies may be installed from the package repositories.  Because
function autoloading doesn’t work with generic methods, you’ll need to
require the libraries in addition to simply installing them.

   There is currently only one country library written for EBDB,
‘ebdb-i18n-chn’, for Chinese-related fields.  It parses and displays
phone numbers and names correctly, and also allows users to search on
Chinese names using pinyin.  It can be installed from ELPA, and requires
the ‘pyim’ package, available on MELPA.

   The present dearth of libraries is a result of the author scratching
his own itch.  Contributions of new libraries are very welcome (see
*note Writing Internationalization Libraries::).  Also welcome, though
less enthusiastically, are requests for new libraries.

   Internationalization libraries do not modify the database, and can be
safely unloaded.  They simply alter the way EBDB reads, parses and
displays field values, and can also store extra information (eg. for
searching purposes) in a record’s cache.  Loading internationalization
libraries may slow down initial database loading, though they should not
significantly impact search or display performance.

   Actually, the internationalization library does alter database
storage in one way: address countries can be either stored as a string
(non-international-aware), or a three-letter symbol representing the
country code (international-aware).  EBDB will correctly display the
country name for either type of storage, regardless of whether the
internationalization library is loaded or not.

   Country names are displayed in English by default, but users can
alter the display of some country names if they choose.

 -- User Option: ebdb-i18n-countries-pref-scripts
     This is an alist of conses pairing string country names to symbol
     labels—see the value of ‘ebdb-i18n-countries’ for the correct
     format, and to find the correct symbol label.  Values set in this
     option will shadow the values in the variable.

10 Diary Integration
********************

Some EBDB fields hold dates or anniversaries (most notably the
‘ebdb-field-anniversary’ field).  It’s possible to integrate this
information with Emacs’ diary package (and from there to Org, via the
‘org-agenda-include-diary’ option).  At present, you’ll need to have an
actual diary file present at the location indicated by ‘diary-file’,
though the file can be blank.

 -- User Option: ebdb-use-diary
     If non-nil, EBDB fields with date information will attempt to add
     that information to the diary.

   When viewing the calendar, you can use the ‘d’ key to see diary
information for that day.

   Support for this feature is rudimentary.  More customization options
are forthcoming.


File: ebdb.info,  Node: Mail Aliases,  Next: vCard Support,  Prev: Diary Integration,  Up: Top

11 Mail Aliases
***************

You can give records a mail alias with the “mail alias” field, available
in the list of choices for inserting new fields.  You’ll be prompted for
an alias, and an email address to use for the alias, if the record has
more than one.  If multiple records have the same alias, then entering
that alias in the “To:” or “Cc:” field of a message composition buffer
will expand to a comma-separated list of record addresses.

   Mail aliases are updated every time an EBDB buffer is created.  It’s
also possible to force an update using the ‘A’ key in a *EBDB* buffer.


File: ebdb.info,  Node: vCard Support,  Next: Org Integration,  Prev: Mail Aliases,  Up: Top

12 vCard Support
****************

EBDB has rudimentary support for exporting to vCard format; this
functionality will be expanded in the future.  After loading the
‘ebdb-vcard’ library, a vCard formatter will be available when
formatting EBDB records (see *note Exporting/Formatting::).

   Support for importing vCard files is on the EBDB roadmap, as is,
eventually, support for CardDav servers.


File: ebdb.info,  Node: Org Integration,  Next: Citing Records,  Prev: vCard Support,  Up: Top

13 Org Integration
******************

EBDB has standard support for Org functionality: creating links to EBDB
records works as expected with ‘C-c l’, and following a link will open
an *EBDB* buffer and display the linked record.

   Typically, links are created using the record’s UUID field—these
links are fast and accurate—but it’s also possible to create links that
initiate an EBDB search, and return multiple records.  EBDB links are of
the format “ebdb:<field type>/<search string>”.  The ‘field type’ is
typically the name of an EBDB field class (for instance,
“ebdb-field-anniversary”), and opening a link of this sort results in a
search of all records for which ‘search string’ matches the string value
of that particular field type.

   For convenience, a few field type shorthands are recognized: in
addition to “uuid”, there is “mail”, “phone”, “address”, “notes” and
“tags” (see below).  For instance, to create a link to all records with
a 206 phone area code, use “<phone/206>”, and to create a link to all
records who work at Google, use “<mail/google.com>”.

   The ‘ebdb-org’ library also contains the ‘ebdb-org-field-tags’ field
class, allowing users to tag their contacts with existing Org tags.
Completion is offered as expected.  *note Tag Field: Tag field.

   This library comes with one other function that allows you to pop up
an *EBDB* buffer alongside an Org Agenda buffer.

 -- Command: ebdb-org-agenda-popup
     Pop up an EBDB buffer displaying contacts matching the tags used to
     create the Agenda buffer.  Only does anything in a tags search
     Agenda buffer.

   This function could also be added to the ‘org-agenda-mode-hook’, to
pop up a buffer any time relevant records are found.

14 Citing Records
*****************

Often one wants to share contact information into other channels: for
instance, pasting a contact’s name and mail address in a message you’re
sending to someone else.  EBDB refers to this as “citing”, and provides
a general interface to this through:

 -- Command: ebdb-cite-records
     This command is not bound in any mode, but can be called
     interactively.  It prompts for a record, then inserts a citation
     for the record into the current buffer.  In most text-mode buffers,
     the citation looks like “Some Name <some@email.com>”.  In Org
     buffers, it is a link with a “mailto:” prefix.

15 Hacking EBDB
***************

EBDB is designed to be highly extensible.  In addition to the usual
customization options, it provides for subclassing of the three main
classes: database, record, and field.  The behavior of EBDB can be
radically changed by creating new classes, or overriding the existing
methods of classes, without touching the original source code.  This
manual won’t go into details about Emacs’ object-orientation support:
see *note EIEIO: (eieio)Top. for information on defining classes, and
*note Generic Functions: (elisp)Generic Functions. for information on
writing generic functions and methods.

   The simplest customization involves changing the default classes used
for basic record and field types.

 -- User Option: ebdb-default-record-class
     The default class used for creating records.  This class will be
     used when creating records with ‘c’ in ebdb-mode, or when
     automatically creating records (ie, from snarfing).  It’s always
     possible to create a record of a different class by using ‘C’ in
     ebdb-mode.

 -- User Option: ebdb-default-record-class
     The default class for complex names.  Simple names (used for
     organizations and nicknames) are always plain strings—this option
     only governs the class used for articulated names of individuals,
     with separate slots for surname, given names, suffixes, etc.

 -- User Option: ebdb-default-mail-class
     The default class for mail fields.

 -- User Option: ebdb-default-phone-class
     The default class for phone fields.

 -- User Option: ebdb-default-address-class
     The default class for address fields.

 -- User Option: ebdb-default-notes-class
     The default class for notes fields.

   If, for instance, you’d like to create a custom mail field and have
all records use that instead of the built-in one:

     (defclass my-mail-field (ebdb-field-mail)
       ;; custom slots
       )

     (setq ebdb-default-mail-class my-mail-field)

   Note that there are currently no facilities for changing the class of
existing objects.  This may be addressed in the future.

File: ebdb.info,  Node: Field Classes,  Next: Writing Internationalization Libraries,  Up: Hacking EBDB

15.1 Field Classes
==================

It’s fairly easy to create your own custom field classes in EBDB. All
such fields should subclass the ‘ebdb-field-user’ class, which sets up
basic behavior.  That base class provides for no slots at all, so your
class must define the slots where the field data will be held.  It
should also provide a class option holding a human-readable string for
the class type.  As an example:

     (defclass ebdb-field-gender (ebdb-field-user)
       ((gender
         :initarg :gender
         :initform unknown
         :type symbol
         :custom (choice
                  (const :tag "Female" female)
                  (const :tag "Male" male)
                  (const :tag "Other" other)
                  (const :tag "Unknown" unknown)
                  (const :tag "None/Not Applicable" none))))
       :human-readable "gender"
       :documentation "A field holding gender information about this record.")

   Once the class itself is defined, there are three basic methods which
must be provided: ‘ebdb-read’, which prompts the user for values used to
create a new field instance, ‘ebdb-parse’, which accepts a string or
other data and creates a new field instance from it, and ‘ebdb-string’,
which returns a string representation of the field instance.  The
simplest field types only need to provide these three methods.

   The ‘ebdb-read’ and ‘ebdb-parse’ methods are static (class-level)
methods.  Both take an optional ‘slots’ argument, which a plist of slot
values that will eventually be fed to ‘make-instance’.  If values are
already present in the plist, these methods should _not_ override them.
In addition, ‘ebdb-read’ takes an optional ‘obj’ argument, which, if
present, is an existing field instance that can be used to provide
default values for the new object.

     (cl-defmethod ebdb-read ((class (subclass ebdb-field-gender))
                              &optional slots obj)
       (unless (plist-get slots :gender)
         (let ((gender (intern (completing-read
                                "Gender: " '(female male other unknown none)
                                nil t
                                (when obj (symbol-name (slot-value obj :gender)))))))
           (setq slots (plist-put slots :gender gender))))
       (cl-call-next-method class slots obj))

     (cl-defmethod ebdb-parse ((class (subclass ebdb-field-gender))
                               str &optional slots)
       (when (and (null (plist-get slots :gender))
                  (member str '("female" "male" "other" "unknown" "none")))
         (setq slots (plist-put slots :gender (intern str)))
       (cl-call-next-method class str slots))

     (cl-defmethod ebdb-string ((field ebdb-field-gender))
       (symbol-name (slot-value field 'gender)))

15.1.1 Init and Delete Methods
------------------------------

It’s also very common to define ‘ebdb-init-field’ and
‘ebdb-delete-field’ methods for classes.  These methods can be used to
maintain secondary data structures, or set up extra hashing for records,
or do any other supplemental work.  The one restriction is that they
must not change the database: they may not edit records or their fields.

 -- Method: ebdb-init-field field record
     Initialize FIELD against RECORD.

 -- Method: ebdb-delete-field field &optional record unload
     Delete FIELD of record RECORD.  If the optional argument UNLOAD is
     non-nil, it means the record is only being unloaded

   Both methods should always end with a call to ‘cl-call-next-method’.

   ‘ebdb-init-field’ is called:

  1. When loading for the first time (records call ‘ebdb-init-field’ on
     all of their fields after they’re loaded).
  2. When adding a new field instance to a record.
  3. When editing an existing field instance (editing is a
     delete-and-create operation).

   ‘ebdb-delete-field’ is called:

  1. When deleting a field instance.
  2. When deleting the record owning the field instance.
  3. When editing an existing field instance (editing is a
     delete-and-create operation).
  4. When unloading a record from the database (the optional third
     UNLOAD argument will be non-nil).

15.1.2 The Labeled Field Class
------------------------------

Many field classes maintain their own list of labels: ie, anniversary
fields can be labeled “birthday”, “wedding”, etc.  This functionality
can be added to fields by additionally subclassing the
‘ebdb-field-labeled’ class, and then defining a variable that will be
used to hold labels, and pointing to it in the class-allocated
“label-list” slot.  Everything else is taken care of automatically.

     (defvar my-field-label-list '("default1" "default2")
       "A list of labels for the my-labeled-field class.")

     (defclass my-labeled-field (ebdb-field-user ebdb-field-labeled)
       ((label-list :initform my-field-label-list)))

15.1.3 The Singleton Field Class
--------------------------------

Another abstract mix-in class is the ‘ebdb-field-singleton’ class.  Its
only function is to ensure that a record only ever has one instance of
the class in question.  If the user tries to add a second instance, the
existing instance is deleted.

15.1.4 Actions
--------------

All field classes have a class-allocated slot called “actions”.  The
value of this slot is a list of conses, for instance: ‘("Browse URL" .
ebdb-field-url-browse)’.  Users can trigger these actions by pressing
‘<RET>’“ while point is on the field in the *EBDB* buffer, using a
numeric prefix arg to select from multiple possible actions, or the 0
prefix arg to be prompted for which action to take.

   The functions in this list should accept two arguments, the record
and the field instance under point.

15.1.5 Custom Field Searching
-----------------------------

In most cases, searching the EBDB database is a matter of prompting for
a regular expression, then matching that regexp against the result of
‘ebdb-string’ called on a field instance.

   However, it is possible for field classes to provide more
sophisticated searching behavior, if desired.  When the user calls
‘ebdb-search-user-fields’ in the *EBDB* buffer, he or she will be
prompted for a field class to search on.  When a field class is chosen,
it has the option to prompt for more complex search criteria.  This is
done by overriding two matching methods: ‘ebdb-search-read’, and
‘ebdb-field-search’.

   ‘ebdb-search-read’ is a static (class-level) method.  Its only
argument is the field class being searched on.  It should prompt the
user for whatever search criterion it wants, then return that criterion.
This can be nearly anything, so long as the matching ‘ebdb-field-search’
can accept it.

   The ‘ebdb-field-search’ method accepts a field instance as the first
argument, and the search criterion as the second.  It should return
non-nil if the criterion somehow matches the field.  Note that it’s
perfectly possible to write several ‘ebdb-field-search’ methods,
dispatching on different criterion types, if that makes things easier.

   In addition, fields that subclass ‘ebdb-field-labeled’ can accept
search criterion as a cons: ‘("label string" . other-search-criteria)’.
The label string will first be matched against the label of the
instance, and then other-search-criteria will be passed to the
‘ebdb-field-search’ method as usual.

   That might sound a bit confusing, here’s an example.  These are the
search methods for the ‘ebdb-field-tags’ class.

     (cl-defmethod ebdb-search-read ((_class (subclass ebdb-field-tags)))
       (cdr
        (org-make-tags-matcher
         (ebdb-read-string
          "Search for tags (eg +tag1-tag2|tag3): "))))

     (cl-defmethod ebdb-field-search ((field ebdb-field-tags)
                                      func)
       (when (functionp func)
         (funcall func t (slot-value field 'tags) 1)))

     (cl-defmethod ebdb-field-search ((field ebdb-field-tags)
                                      (tag string))
       (seq-find (lambda (tg) (string-match-p tag tg))
                 (slot-value field 'tags)))

   The ‘ebdb-search-read’ method returns a lambda (the ‘cdr’ of the
return value of ‘org-make-tags-matcher’.  The first ‘ebdb-field-search’
method handles that lambda, simply by calling it.  The second
‘ebdb-field-search’ method handles a string search criterion; though no
EBDB code would create this search, external code conceivably might.


File: ebdb.info,  Node: Fast Lookups,  Next: Formatting in the EBDB Buffer,  Prev: Custom Field Searching,  Up: Field Classes

15.1.6 Fast Lookups
-------------------

Usually, searches of the database are conducted by looping over all the
records and testing each search clause against each record.
Theoretically, this could be a slow process.

   By contrast, “fast lookups” use a central hashtable, the
‘ebdb-hashtable’, to look up search strings quickly.  By default,
records names, email addresses, and tags are indexed in this central
hashtable.  To short-circuit the usual slow lookup and use the fast
hashtable lookup, specify one of those three field names as the ‘car’ of
the search criteria, and prefix the string ‘cdr’ of the criteria with a
“^” (the behavior of ‘all-completions’ requires a string prefix):

     (ebdb-search (ebdb-records) '((ebdb-field-tag "^client")))

   It’s possible to use these fast lookups in interactive searches, when
selecting a specific field type to search on, but the time spent typing
a “^” will undoubtedly outweigh the time saved in the search.  This is
mostly useful in non-interactive searches.

   It’s also possible to specify additional field types which can be
used with fast lookups.  The first step is to write ‘ebdb-init-field’
and ‘ebdb-delete-field’ methods that hash and unhash the record against
the field string in the ‘ebdb-hashtable’.

   Next, add an element to the ‘ebdb-hash-extra-predicates’ variable.
The element should be a cons cell where the ‘car’ is the field class
name, as a symbol, and the ‘cdr’ is a lambda which accepts the search
string and a record, and returns ‘t’ if the search string does indeed
match the instance of that field (and not some other field string).

15.1.7 Formatting in the EBDB Buffer
------------------------------------

Most fields will be displayed in the *EBDB* buffer simply using
‘ebdb-string’.  It’s possible to customize this display by overriding
the ‘ebdb-fmt-field’ method.  Without going into too much detail, this
method dispatches on four arguments: the formatter, the field, a “style”
symbol argument (typically ‘normal’, ‘oneline’, ‘compact’, ‘collapse’ or
‘expanded’), and the record being formatted.

   Specify an ebdb formatter for the first argument to target *EBDB*
formatting.  Choices are ‘ebdb-formatter-ebdb’ (for all cases), or one
of ‘ebdb-formatter-ebdb-multiline’ or ‘ebdb-formatter-ebdb-oneline’.
Keep in mind that many field classes are not displayed at all in the
oneline format.

   An example: most fields are output with style set to ‘normal’,
meaning that it will use the value of ‘ebdb-string’.  By default,
formatters display address fields in the ‘collapse’ style, which is
mapped to the ‘oneline’ style, which simply drops everything after the
first newline.

   Say you still wanted addresses output on a single line, but you
wanted to provide a little more information on that line: the first line
of the street addresses, plus the city, plus the country.  You could
achieve that by overriding the ‘collapse’ style like so:

     (cl-defmethod ebdb-fmt-field ((_fmt ebdb-formatter)
                                   (field ebdb-field-address)
                                   (_style (eql collapse))
                                   (_record ebdb-record))
       "Give address fields a special 'collapse formatting."
       (with-slots (streets locality country) field
        (format "%s (%s, %s)" (car streets) locality country)))


   The leading underscores on parameters are there to keep the compiler
quiet: the arguments are necessary for dispatch, but aren’t actually
used in the body of the method.


File: ebdb.info,  Node: Writing Internationalization Libraries,  Next: Writing Integration For New MUAs,  Prev: Field Classes,  Up: Hacking EBDB

15.2 Writing Internationalization Libraries
===========================================

Writing new internationalization libraries involves using generic
functions.  *note Generic Functions: (elisp)Generic Functions.  It will
also require a bit of familiarity with EBDB’s internals.

   Internationalization affects three different field types: addresses,
phone numbers, and names.  It works by providing “i18n” versions of
common methods for those three fields:

Regular method      Internationalized method
-----------------------------------------------
ebdb-read           ebdb-read-i18n
ebdb-parse          ebdb-parse-i18n
ebdb-string         ebdb-string-i18n
ebdb-init-field     ebdb-init-field-i18n
ebdb-delete-field   ebdb-delete-field-i18n

   When the “ebdb-i18n” library is loaded and the left-column
(“vanilla”) versions of field methods are called, EBDB first checks to
see if a valid “internationalized” (right-column) method exists.  If it
does, that method is used instead of the vanilla one.

   What is a “valid internationalized method”?  That depends on the
field type.  Each field type uses a different key or “spec” to determine
the nationality or locality of the field instance.

   • Address fields use a three-character symbol derived from the ISO
     316601 alpha 3 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3)
     country codes.  These codes can be found in the variable
     ‘ebdb-i18n-countries’.
   • Phone fields use the phone number’s numerical country code as a
     spec.  These codes can be found in the variable
     ‘ebdb-i18n-phone-codes’.
   • Name fields are keyed to the symbol representing the script used to
     write them.  Specifically, the first character CHAR of the name is
     tested in this way: ‘(aref char-script-table CHAR)’, which returns
     a symbol.

   How are these “specs” used?  Each internationalized version of the
above methods accepts the spec as an additional argument, which it is
able to specialize on.  Every country-specific method should check the
spec to see if it is relevant to that library.  If so, it handles the
necessary behavior; if not, it passes by using ‘cl-call-next-method’.
See the function signatures of each internationalized method to find how
to handle the extra argument, called SPEC.

   Here’s a concrete example:

   Say we want to make sure all French phone numbers are represented by
a string that looks like “+33 05 12 34 56 79”.  This is not how they are
stored in the database, but this is how they should be represented to
the user.  We need to override the ‘ebdb-string-i18n’ method for the
phone field class.  This method takes two arguments—the field instance,
and the country-code spec—and needs to specialize on both arguments.
The method signature will look like this:

     (cl-defmethod ebdb-string-i18n ((phone ebdb-field-phone)
                                     (_cc (eql 33))))

   See the manual on generic functions for details; suffice it to say
that this method will only run when the first argument is an instance of
the ‘ebdb-field-phone’ class (or a subclass), and the second argument is
‘eql’ to the number 33.

   We know that this method will only run for French phone numbers, so
we can format the number correctly:

     (cl-defmethod ebdb-string-i18n ((phone ebdb-field-phone)
                                     (_cc (eql 33)))
       (with-slots (area-code number extension) phone
         (concat
          "+33 "
          (when area-code
            (format "%02d" area-code))
          (format "%s%s %s%s %s%s %s%s"
                  (split-string number "" t))
          (when extension
            (format "X%d" extension)))))

   Again this only affects the display of numbers, not how they are
stored in the database.

   Note that, while phone numbers themselves are stored as strings (they
do not represent a quantity, after all), the country and area codes are
stored as numbers, precisely so that they can be specialized on using
‘eql’.

   See the signatures of the other internationalized methods for how to
use them.  The symbol specs for country codes and script names can also
be specialized on with the ‘eql’ specializer.

15.3 Writing Integration For New MUAs
=====================================

Theoretically EBDB can be incorporated into any Emacs package, but it’s
most commonly used in conjunction with a mail user agent.  It comes with
support for a few MUAs out of the box, but integration with a new one
can be written fairly easily.

   The first step of integration involves hooking the function
‘ebdb-mua-auto-update’ somewhere into the MUA’s operation.  For most
MUAs, the appropriate place is when a message or article is opened for
viewing by the user.  This allows EBDB to act on the information found
in that message.

   The second step requires providing new versions of a handful of
generic functions.  All MUA-specific generic functions specialize on the
current major-mode, using the ‘&context’ specializer.  See below for
examples.

   When ‘ebdb-mua-auto-update’ runs, it scans the headers of the current
article/message for name/mail data, and uses that data to locate,
create, edit, and display records.  It does this by calling the generic
function ‘ebdb-mua-message-header’ with the string header name; it is
the responsibility of the MUA to implement this function, and return the
contents of the appropriate header.  For instance, in Gnus:

     (cl-defmethod ebdb-mua-message-header ((header string)
                                        &context (major-mode gnus-summary-mode))
       "Return value of HEADER for current Gnus message."
       (set-buffer gnus-article-buffer)
       (gnus-fetch-original-field header))

   The first argument is the string header, and the second is the
specializer on the current major-mode.  Possible header values include
those found in ‘ebdb-message-headers’.  Note that if you expect this
function to be called in more than one major-mode, you’ll have to
provide multiple versions of the function.  The &context specializer
uses ‘derived-mode-p’ behind the scenes, though, so if all the modes
derive from a single parent mode (and the behavior should be the same in
all derived modes) it is enough to specialize on the parent mode.

   Some MUAs might need to do a bit of work to ensure that the article
in question is opened and set up properly:

 -- Method: ebdb-mua-prepare-article
     Called with no argument but the mode specializer, this function
     should do whatever is necessary to prepare the article.

   Providing *EBDB* buffer pop-up support involves implementing two
separate functions:

 -- Method: ebdb-make-buffer-name
     Called with no arguments but the mode specializer, this function
     should return the string name of the *EBDB* buffer to be associated
     with this MUA. Usually the function body will look like: ‘(format
     "*%s-<mua>" ebdb-buffer-name)’.

 -- Method: ebdb-popup-window
     Called with no arguments but the mode specializer, this function
     should return a list of two elements: the window to be split to
     make room for the *EBDB* buffer window, and a float value between 0
     and 1 indicating the size of the new *EBDB* buffer window, as a
     percentage of the window being split.

   In addition, it might be nice to bind the ‘ebdb-mua-keymap’ in the
MUA’s mode-map.  This map provides bindings for some commonly-used EBDB
functions.

15.3.1 Article snarfing
-----------------------

EBDB can scan articles or messages for likely field information, and
prompt the user to add the fields to new or existing records—this is
done by the user with the interactive command ‘ebdb-mua-snarf-article’.
In order to work, the MUA must be able to provide that function with the
text of the message body, and the text of the message signature (if
any).  This is done with two generic functions:

 -- Method: ebdb-mua-article-body
     Return the text of the article body, or nil.

 -- Method: ebdb-mua-article-signature
     Return the text of the article signature, or nil.
