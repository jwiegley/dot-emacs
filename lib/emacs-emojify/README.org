** What is this?
   Emojify is an Emacs extension to display emojis. It can display github style
   emojis like ~:smile:~ or plain ascii ones like ~:)~. It tries to be as
   efficient as possible, while also providing a lot of [[#customizations][flexibility]]

** What does it look like?
   Here is how the commit log of this project looks with emojify mode enabled

   [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iqbalansari/emacs-emojify/master/screenshots/emojify-in-action.png][screenshots/emojify-in-action.png?raw=true]]

   If you prefer a GIF you can view one [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iqbalansari/emacs-emojify/master/screenshots/emojify-in-action.gif][here]].

** Requirements
   This package requires Emacs *v24.3* and above. Emacs should be compiled with
   support for *PNG* images to display emojis as images. It is *recommended*
   that Emacs is compiled with *ImageMagick* support. ~emojify~ will use it to
   resize emojis if needed, additionally imagemagick is used to set background
   color for emojis to workaround the bug described in [[https://github.com/iqbalansari/emacs-emojify/issues/7][issue 7]]. However these
   are *completely optional*.

   PNG support might require some additional steps to on Windows, you might find
   [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2650041/emacs-under-windows-and-png-files][this]] stackoverflow answer helpful.

** Installation
*** ELPA
    ~emojify~ is available on [[http://melpa.org/#/emojify][MELPA]] and [[http://stable.melpa.org/#/emojify][MELPA Stable]]. Please follow the instructions on MELPA
    [[http://melpa.org/#/getting-started][website]] to enable it, if you haven't already.

    You can then install ~emojify~ from the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Package-Menu.html][package menu]]. Alternatively install it by doing the following

    Refresh the package index
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    M-x package-refresh-contents RET
    #+END_QUOTE

    And then install it by doing
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    M-x package-install RET emojify
    #+END_QUOTE

** Usage
*** Displaying emojis
    ~emojify-mode~ can be enabled/disabled separately for a buffer by using the
    command ~emojify-mode~, to enable/disable it globally use the command
    ~global-emojify-mode~.

    To enable ~emojify-mode~ globally at startup add something like the
    following to your ~init~ file

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-emojify-mode)
    #+END_SRC

    Emojify integrates with packages like ~prettify-symbol-mode~ and
    ~org-bullets-mode~ which display text differently, if the alternate text
    displayed by these packages match an emoji, ~emojify~ will display them too.
    See [[#displaying-composed-text-as-emojis][Displaying composed text as emojis]] for more details. Emojify can also
    display emojis in ~company-mode~ tooltips, see [[#displaying-emojis-in-company-mode-tooltips][Displaying emojis in company mode tooltips]]
    for more details.

    *[EXPERIMENTAL]* Emojify can be used for displaying emojis in the mode-line,
    to enable/disable it for individual buffers use the command
    ~emojify-mode-line-mode~, to enable/disable it globally use the command
    ~global-emojify-mode-line-mode~.

*** Searching emojis
    The command ~emojify-apropos-emoji~ can be used to display emojis that match
    given regexp/apropos pattern. The results are displayed in a specialized
    buffer, where ~w~ or ~c~ can be used to copy emojis to the kill ring.

*** Inserting emojis
    The command ~emojify-insert-emoji~ can be used to insert emojis
    interactively. While the command works with vanilla Emacs completion system,
    the experience would be better with something like [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]], [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][Ivy]], [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Icicles][Icicles]] or Ido
    depending on you preference.

*** Describing emojis
    The command ~emojify-describe-emoji-at-point~ can be used to view
    explanation about the command displayed at point. Additionally the command
    ~emojify-describe-emoji~ can be used to display description for an arbitrary
    emoji.

*** Listing all emojis
    The command ~emojify-list-emojis~ can be used to view all the available emojis
    in a list form.

** Customizations
*** Displaying composed text as emojis
    Emacs provides a way to modify how some parts of buffer are displayed using
    the ~composition~ text property. ~prettify-symbol-mode~ and
    ~org-bullets-mode~ are some popular packages that use this feature to
    display certain text in the buffer differently.

    If the alternate display matches an emoji then ~emojify~ will display those
    as emojis too. This is default behaviour. You can disable this behaviour by
    setting ~emojify-composed-text-p~ to ~nil~.

*** Displaying emojis in company mode tooltips
    Emojify can also display emojis that are part of company-mode's completion
    tooltip (see [[https://github.com/dunn/company-emoji][company-emoji]] for an example of such tooltips). However this
    feature is turned off by default. To turn it on set
    ~emojify-company-tooltips-p~ to ~t~.

*** Configuring the types of emojis displayed
    Emojify by default displays plain text emojis (~:)~), unicode emojis (~😄~)
    and github style emojis ~:smile:~. However this is customizable. You can do
    so by changing the value of ~emojify-emoji-styles~ using the customize
    interface. To change the value of the variable from Lisp using the function
    ~emojify-set-emoji-styles~ (or set it before loading ~emojify~), call it with
    one parameter the list of styles that you want to be displayed. The possible
    styles are

    - ascii            - Display only plain ascii emojis
    - unicode          - Display only unicode emojis
    - github           - Display only github style emojis

*** Configuring how emojis are displayed
    By default emojis are displayed using images. However you can instruct emojify
    to display it using unicode characters or ascii characters. To do so customize
    the variable ~emojify-display-style~.

    You can set it one of the following values
    - image   - Display emojis using images, obviously this requires the Emacs
                instance to support image
    - unicode - Display emojis using unicode characters, this might be a good
                option on platforms with good emoji fonts
    - ascii   - This is simplest and does not require any external dependencies
                In this case emojify will display ascii equivalents of github
                style emojis.

*** Configuring the buffers where emojify mode is enabled
    You can control the buffers where emojify is enabled using
    ~emojify-inhibit-major-modes~ and ~emojify-inhibit-in-buffer-functions~.

**** Major modes where emojify-mode should be not be enabled
     As the names suggests ~emojify-inhibit-major-modes~ is a list of major-modes
     where ~emojify~ should not be enabled.

**** Inhibiting emojify-mode using custom functions
     ~emojify-inhibit-in-buffer-functions~ is a list of functions that ~emojify~
     calls before enabling ~emojify-mode~ in a buffer. If any of the functions
     return a non-nil value ~emojify-mode~ is not enabled in the buffer. Users
     can add custom functions to this list if they wish to inhibit ~emojify~ in
     certain buffers. The functions are called with one argument the buffer
     where ~emojify-mode~ is about to be enabled.

*** Configuring the texts that are displayed as emojis
    ~emojify~ offers two variables to inhibit the display of certain emojis.

**** Controlling the display of emojis in programming modes
     If enabled in programming modes ~emojify~ by default will display only emojis
     in string and comments. This behaviour can be customized using the variable
     ~emojify-prog-contexts~. The variable can be set to one of the following values

     - comments - Display emojis only in comments
     - string   - Display emojis only in string
     - both     - Display emojis in comments as well as string
     - none     - Do not display emojis in programming modes

**** Inhibiting display of emojis using custom functions
     ~emojify-inhibit-functions~ is a list of function ~emojify~ calls before
     displaying certain text as emoji, if any of the functions return a non-nil
     value the corresponding text is not displayed as emoji. Users can add
     custom functions to this list, if they inhibit display of emojis in under
     certain conditions. The functions are called with three arguments

     - text - The text that is about to be displayed as an emoji
     - beg  - The beginning point of text in the buffer
     - end  - The ending point of text in the buffer

     These functions are called with the buffer where emoji is being displayed
     selected.

*** Customizing the behaviour when point enters an emoji
    The behaviour when point enters an emoji can be customized using the
    variable ~emojify-point-entered-behaviour~. It can have one of the following
    values

    - echo    - Display the emojified text in the minibuffer
    - uncover - Temporarily display the underlying text while point is in the emojified text

    Additionally it can be set to a custom function, the function is called with
    two parameters (the buffer where the emoji appears is selected while running
    the function)

    - beg    - The beginning position of the text displayed as emoji
    - end    - The ending position of the text displayed as emoji

    The return value of the function is ignored.

    *Note:* The custom function will be called for once for each character in an
    emoji as point moves through them. Avoid manipulating the buffer in these
    functions

*** Customizing the behaviour during isearch-mode
    By default in isearch-mode the underlying emoji is displayed temporarily
    when point enters the emoji while searching (similar to ~uncover~ behaviour
    mentioned [[#controlling-behaviour-when-point-enters-an-emoji][above]]). This can be disabled by setting
    ~emojify-reveal-on-isearch~ to ~nil~.

*** Customizing the behaviour when mouse hovers over an emoji
    When mouse hovers over a emoji, the underlying text is displayed in a help
    popup. This behaviour can be disabled by setting ~emojify-show-help~ to nil.

*** Custom emojis
    You can specify custom emojis using the ~emojify-user-emojis~ variable.  You
    need to set it to an alist where first element of cons is the text to be
    displayed as emoji, while the second element of the cons is an alist
    containing data about the emoji.

    The inner alist should have atleast

    1) "name"  - The name of the emoji
    2) "style" - This should be one of "github", "ascii" or "github"

    Additionally the alist should contain one of (see [[#configuring-the-types-of-emojis-displayed][emojify-display-style]])
    1) "unicode" - The replacement for the provided emoji for "unicode" display style
    2) "image"   - The replacement for the provided emoji for "image" display style.
                   This should be the *absolute* path to the image
    3) "ascii"   - The replacement for the provided emoji for "ascii" display style

    It is best to set this variable before you load ~emojify~, in case you set
    this variable after loading ~emojify~ run the function
    ~emojify-set-emoji-data~ to recalculate emoji data.

    User emojis take precedence over default emojis so the above mechanism can
    also be used to override the default emojis

**** Example
     Below is an example of setting up custom emojis. Assuming that the custom
     images are at ~\~/.emacs.d/emojis/trollface.png~ and
     ~\~/.emacs.d/emojis/neckbeard.png~, you instruct ~emojify~ to display ~:trollface:~
     and ~:neckbeard:~ as :trollface: and :neckbeard:

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (setq emojify-user-emojis '((":trollface:" . (("name" . "Troll Face")
                                                     ("image" . "~/.emacs.d/emojis/trollface.png")
                                                     ("style" . "github")))
                                   (":neckbeard:" . (("name" . "Neckbeard")
                                                     ("image" . "~/.emacs.d/emojis/neckbeard.png")
                                                     ("style" . "github")))))

       ;; If emojify is already loaded refresh emoji data
       (when (featurep 'emojify)
         (emojify-set-emoji-data))
     #+END_SRC

** Known issues
   - Emojis are not properly updated after customizing ~emojify-display-style~ or
     ~emojify-program-contexts~. For time being you will be fine as long as you
     set these variables before ~emojify~ has loaded.
   - Some of the emojis prompted in the commands like ~emojify-insert-emoji~ might
     not be displayed by ~emojify~, this might happen if you have newer emoji
     data but old set of images. Download the latest emoji image using ~emojify-download-emoji~
     and set ~emojify-emoji-set~ to the downloaded set.
