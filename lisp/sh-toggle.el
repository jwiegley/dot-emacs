;;; Commentary:

;; Provides the command shell-toggle which toggles between the
;; *shell* buffer and whatever buffer you are editing.
;;
;; This is done in an "intelligent" way.  Features are:
;;
;;  - Starts a shell if non is existing.
;;
;;  - Minimum distortion of your window configuration.
;;
;;  - When done in the shell-buffer you are returned to the same
;;    window configuration you had before you toggled to the shell.
;;
;;  - If you desire, you automagically get a "cd" command in the
;;    shell to the directory where your current buffers file exists;
;;    just call shell-toggle-cd instead of shell-toggle.
;;
;;  - You can convinently choose if you want to have the shell in
;;    another window or in the whole frame.  Just invoke shell-toggle
;;    again to get the shell in the whole frame.
;;
;; This file has been tested under Emacs 20.2.
;;
;; To use, call the functions `shell-toggle' or `shell-toggle-cd'.
;; It's most helpful to bind these to a key.
