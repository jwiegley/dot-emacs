;;; Commentary:

;; A simple mode for snarfing stock quotes.
;;
;; To obtain a quote, type `M-x stock-quote', and enter the ticker
;; symbol.
;;
;; To watch a quote in the modeline, configure the variable
;; `stock-quote-in-modeline' with the name of the ticker symbol to
;; watch.
;;
;; To change the way that quotes are obtained, write a new function
;; and add-hook it to `stock-quote-data-functions'.  It will be passed
;; the ticker name, and should return the price if it can.  The
;; default method uses the Money Quick Quotes web page, and the W3
;; package.
;;
;; If you want Emacs to do certain things when certain conditions are
;; met, you should configure the triggers and actions variables.  Only
;; a few predefined triggers are given, but the mechanism is
;; extensible.  Just add your trigger function to
;; `stock-quote-trigger-functions'.  It will be given the ticker name
;; and price (as a floating point value).  If the function returns a
;; string, representing the reason why the trigger is firing, then the
;; trigger is considered as having fired, and an action will be
;; performed.
;;
;; Actions are functions that have been add-hook'd to
;; `stock-quote-trigger-functions'.  If the first action to return a
;; non-nil value is chosen.  They can do anything, and will be passed
;; the ticker name, the price, and the reason returned by the trigger
;; function.
;;
;; And always remember: profit isn't real until its real.
