;;; Commentary:

;; The module changes Ediff conflicts regions to match the appearance and
;; meaning of diff3, plus adds an "x" key prefix in the Ediff Control Panel
;; for picking two or three out of the displayed regions.
;;
;; For example:
;;
;;   a       Select region A
;;   b       Select region B
;;   x a     Exclude region A (keep ancestor and B)
;;   x b     Exclude region B (keep ancestor and A)
;;   x c     Exclude ancestor (keep A and B)
;;
;; I recommend using Smerge mode for direct editing of diff3 output files:
;;
;;   (add-hook 'diff-mode-hook 'smerge-mode)
;;
;; Also, to remain sane, change Ediff's merge display to be the same as diff3:
;;
;;   (setq ediff-combination-pattern
;;         '("<<<<<<< A: HEAD" A "||||||| Ancestor" Ancestor
;;           "=======" B ">>>>>>> B: Incoming"))
