;;; Commentary:

;; This code has not been optimized, and I welcome any improvements.
;; As it is, the resulting conversion of a large Lisp form to a
;; base64-encoded string, using `lzw-compress-data', achieves a
;; compression ratio near 50% over just turning the data into a string
;; with `prin1-to-string'.
