now maintained by Michael Olson.  Several versions of this manual are
available on-line.

@node Introduction, Obtaining Muse, Preface, Top
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@chapter What is Muse?

Emacs Muse (also known as ``Muse'' or ``Emacs-Muse'') is an authoring
and publishing environment for Emacs.  It simplifies the process of
writing documents and publishing them to various output formats.

Muse consists of two main parts: an enhanced text-mode for authoring
documents and navigating within Muse projects, and a set of publishing
styles for generating different kinds of output.

What makes Muse distinct from other text-publishing systems is a modular
environment, with a rather simple core, in which "styles" are derived
from to create new styles.  Much of Muse's overall functionality is
optional.  For example, you can use the publisher without the
major-mode, or the mode without doing any publishing; or if you don't
load the Texinfo or LaTeX modules, those styles won't be available.

The Muse codebase is a departure from emacs-wiki.el version 2.44. The
code has been restructured and rewritten, especially its publishing
functions.  The focus in this revision is on the authoring and
publishing aspects, and the "wikiness" has been removed as a default
behavior (available in the optional @file{muse-wiki} module).  CamelCase
words are no longer special by default.

One of the principal aims in the development of Muse is to make it very
easy to produce good-looking, standards-compliant documents.

Choose to install a release if you want to minimize risk.

Errors are corrected in development first.  User-visible changes will be
announced on the @email{muse-el-discuss@@gna.org} mailing list.
@xref{Getting Help and Reporting Bugs}.

@cindex releases, Debian package
@cindex Debian package for Muse
Debian users can get Muse via apt-get.  The @file{muse-el} package is
available both at Michael Olson's APT repository and the official Debian
repository.  To make use of the former, add the following line to your
@file{/etc/apt/sources.list} file and run @code{apt-get install muse}.

@example
deb http://mwolson.org/debian/ ./
@end example

@cindex releases, Ubuntu package
@cindex Ubuntu package for Muse
Ubuntu users can also get Muse via apt-get.  The @file{muse-el} package
is available both at Michael Olson's APT repository and the official
Ubuntu repository.  To make use of the former, add the following line to
your @file{/etc/apt/sources.list} file and run @code{apt-get install
muse}.

@example
deb http://mwolson.org/ubuntu/ ./
@end example

The reason for making separate Debian and Ubuntu packages is that this
manual is under the GFDL, and Debian will not allow it to be distributed
in its main repository.  Ubuntu, on the other hand, permits this manual
to be included with the @file{muse-el} package.

@cindex releases, from source
Alternatively, you can download the latest release from
@uref{http://download.gna.org/muse-el/} .

@node Development,  , Releases, Obtaining Muse

@section Latest unreleased development changes
@cindex development

Choose the development version if you want to live on the bleeding edge
of Muse development or try out new features before release.

@cindex git version control system, using
The git version control system allows you to keep up-to-date with the
latest changes to the development version of Muse.  It also allows you
to contribute changes (via commits, if you are have developer access to
the repository, or via patches, otherwise).  If you would like to
contribute to Muse development, it is highly recommended that you use
git.

If you are new to git, you might find this tutorial helpful:
@uref{http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/tutorial.html}.

Downloading the Muse module with git and staying up-to-date involves
the following steps.

@enumerate
@item Install git.

@itemize @bullet
@item Debian and Ubuntu: @kbd{apt-get install git-core}.
@item Windows: @uref{http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/WindowsInstall}.
@item Other operating systems: download, compile, and install the source
from @uref{http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/}, or find a git
package for your operating system.
@end itemize

@item Download the Muse development branch.

If you have developer access to Muse, do:

@example
git clone ssh://repo.or.cz/srv/git/muse-el.git muse
@end example

otherwise, do:

@example
git clone git://repo.or.cz/muse-el.git muse
@end example

If you are behind a restrictive firewall, and do not have developer
access, then do the following instead:

@example
git clone http://repo.or.cz/r/muse-el.git muse
@end example

@item List upstream changes that are missing from your local copy.
Do this whenever you want to see whether new changes have been committed
to Muse.  If you wish, you may skip this step and proceed directly to
the ``update'' step.

@example
# Change to the source directory you are interested in.
cd muse

# Fetch new changes from the repository, but don't apply them yet
git fetch origin

# Display log messages for the new changes
git log HEAD..origin
@end example

``origin'' is git's name for the location where you originally got Muse
from.  You can change this location at any time by editing the
@file{.git/config} file in the directory where the Muse source was
placed.

@cindex updating Muse with git
@item Update to the latest version by pulling in any missing changes.

@example
cd muse
git pull origin
@end example

git will show how many files changed, and will provide a visual display
for how many lines were changed in each file.

@end enumerate

There are other ways to interact with the Muse repository.

@itemize
@item Browse git repo: @uref{http://repo.or.cz/w/muse-el.git}
@item Latest development snapshot: @uref{http://mwolson.org/static/dist/muse-latest.tar.gz}
@item Latest development snapshot (zip file): @uref{http://mwolson.org/static/dist/muse-latest.zip}
@end itemize

The latest development snapshot can lag behind the git repo by as much
as 20 minutes, but never more than that.

If you want commit access to the shared Muse repository, then register
an account at @uref{http://repo.or.cz} (be sure to add an SSH key), and
contact the current maintainer at @email{mwolson@@gnu.org}.  It would be
best to send some patches to the @email{muse-el-discuss@@gna.org}
mailing list first, so that he knows that you know what you are doing.
@xref{Getting Help and Reporting Bugs}, for instructions on subscribing
to the mailing list.

You must also be willing to sign a copyright assignment for your changes
to Muse, since Muse is a GNU project.  The current maintainer will
assist you in this process if you contact him.

For information on committing changes to Muse and performing
development, please consult
@uref{http://emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/MuseDevelopment}.

@node Installation, Getting Started, Obtaining Muse, Top
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@chapter Compiling and Installing Muse

Muse may be compiled and installed on your machine.

@subheading Compilation
@cindex compiling Muse

This is an optional step, since Emacs Lisp source code does not
necessarily have to be byte-compiled.  Byte-compilation may yield a very
slight speed increase.

A working copy of Emacs or XEmacs is needed in order to compile Emacs
Muse.  By default, the program that is installed with the name
@command{emacs} will be used.

If you want to use the @command{xemacs} binary to perform the
compilation, you must copy @file{Makefile.defs.default} to
@file{Makefile.defs} in the top-level directory, and then edit
@file{Makefile.defs} as follows.  You can put either a full path to an
Emacs or XEmacs binary or just the command name, as long as it is in the
@env{PATH}.

@example
EMACS    = xemacs
SITEFLAG = -no-site-file
# Edit the section as necessary
install_info = install-info --section "XEmacs 21.4" $(1).info \
        $(INFODIR)/dir || :
@end example

Running @code{make} in the top-level directory should compile the Muse
source files in the @file{lisp} directory, and generate an autoloads
file in @file{lisp/muse-autoloads.el}.

@subheading Installation
@cindex installing Muse

Muse may be installed into your file hierarchy by doing the following.

Copy @file{Makefile.defs.default} to @file{Makefile.defs} in the
top-level directory, if you haven't done so already.  Then edit the
@file{Makefile.defs} file so that @env{ELISPDIR} points to where you
want the source and compiled Muse files to be installed and
@env{INFODIR} indicates where to put the Muse manual.  You may use a
combination of @env{DESTDIR} and @env{PREFIX} to further determine where
the installed files should be placed.  As mentioned earlier, you will
want to edit @env{EMACS} and @env{SITEFLAG} as shown in the Compilation
section if you are using XEmacs.

If you are installing Muse on a Debian or Ubuntu system, you might want
to change the value of @env{INSTALLINFO} as specified in
@file{Makefile.defs}.

If you wish to install Muse to different locations than the defaults
specify, edit @file{Makefile.defs} accordingly.

Run @code{make} as a normal user, if you haven't done so already.

Run @code{make install} as the root user if you have chosen installation
locations that require root permissions.

@subheading ELPA
@cindex ELPA package for Muse

For those used to installing software packages, there will be a
@code{muse} package available in the Emacs Lisp Package Archive
(abbreviated ``ELPA'') as of the 3.10 release of Muse.  This package
will be compiled and installed automatically in a user-specific
location.  For more information on ELPA, see
@uref{http://tromey.com/elpa/}.

@section How to Load Muse
@cindex settings, init file

To use Muse, add the directory containing its files to your
@code{load-path} variable, in your @file{.emacs} file.  Then, load in
the authoring mode, and the styles you wish to publish to.  An example
follows.

@lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "<path to Muse>")

(require 'muse-mode)     ; load authoring mode

(require 'muse-html)     ; load publishing styles I use
(require 'muse-latex)
(require 'muse-texinfo)
(require 'muse-docbook)

(require 'muse-project)  ; publish files in projects
@end lisp

An easy way of seeing which settings are available and changing settings
is to use the Muse customization interface.  To do this, type
@kbd{M-x customize-group muse RET}.  Each of the options has its own
documentation.  Options are grouped logically according to what effect
they have.

@node Using Muse Mode, Publishing Files Overview, Loading Muse, Getting Started
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section How to Edit Files in Muse
@cindex editing Muse files

Muse Mode should automatically be activated when you visit a file with a
``.muse'' extension.  One such file is @file{QuickStart.muse}, which is
available in the @file{examples} directory of the Muse distribution.
You can tell that Muse Mode has been activated by checking for the text
``Muse'' in your mode line.  If Muse Mode has not been activated, you
may activate it by type @kbd{M-x muse-mode RET}.

You will notice that Muse files are highlighted very simply.  Links are
colored blue, headings are large and bold text, and @verb{|<example>|}
tags are colored in grey.

There are several different ways to edit things like links, which hide
the underlying Muse markup.  One way is to toggle font-locking off by
hitting @kbd{C-c C-l}, which is also @kbd{M-x font-lock-mode}, make
changes, and then hit @kbd{C-c C-l} again to toggle font-locking back
on.  Another way is just to move into the text and edit it.  Markup can
also be removed by normal deletion methods, though some side effects
might require a second deletion.

For the particular case of editing links, it is easiest to move to the
link and do @kbd{C-c C-e}, which is also @kbd{M-x
muse-edit-link-at-point}.  This prompts you for the link and its
description, using the previous contents of the link as initial values.
A link to another Muse file may be created by hitting @kbd{C-c TAB l}.
A link to a URL may be created by hitting @kbd{C-c TAB u}.  Links may be
followed by hitting @kbd{RET} on them.

If you want to add a new list item, this may by accomplished by hitting
@kbd{M-RET}.  This will put a dash and some spaces on the screen.  The
dash is the Muse markup that indicates a list item.  It is also possible
to created ``nested'' lists with this command, by adjusting the number
of spaces in front of the dashes.  If you have lists with long lines,
you can move to a list item and hit @kbd{M-q} to wrap it onto multiple
lines.

@node Publishing Files Overview, File Extensions, Using Muse Mode, Getting Started
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Publishing a Single File or Project
@cindex editing Muse files

The command @kbd{M-x muse-project-publish-this-file} will publish the
current document to any available publishing style (a publishing style
is an output format, like HTML or Docbook), placing the output in the
current directory.  If you are in Muse Mode, this command will be bound
to @kbd{C-c C-t}.  If the file has been published recently, and its
contents have not changed, running @kbd{C-c C-t} again will not publish
the file.  To force publishing in this case, do @kbd{C-u C-c C-t}.

If you have set up projects and are visiting a file that is part of a
project, then @kbd{C-c C-t} will restrict the output formats to those
which are used by the project, and will automatically publish to the
output directory defined by the project.  If you want to publish to a
different directory or use a different format, then use @kbd{C-c M-C-t},
which is also @kbd{M-x muse-publish-this-file}.

If the currently opened file is part of a defined project in
@code{muse-project-alist}, it (and the rest of the changed files in a
project) may be published using @kbd{C-c C-p}.

@node File Extensions, , Publishing Files Overview, Getting Started
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Using a Different File Extension
@cindex file extension, specifying

By default, Muse expects all project files to have the file extension
@file{.muse}. Files without this extension will not be associated with
Muse mode and will not be considered part of any project, even if they
are within a project directory.

If you don't want to use @file{.muse}, you can customize the extension
by setting the value of @code{muse-file-extension}.

If you don't want to use any extension at all, and want Muse to
autodetect project files based on their location, then add the following
to your Muse settings file.

@lisp
(setq muse-file-extension nil
      muse-mode-auto-p t)
@end lisp

Note that if you chose to have @code{muse-file-extension} set to
@code{nil}, you may have trouble if your @file{.emacs} file or other
init scripts attempt to visit a Muse file.  (A very common example of
this is if you use Planner with Muse and run @code{(plan)} from your
@file{.emacs}.)  If you wish to visit Muse files from your
@file{.emacs}, be sure to also add the following additional code before
any such visits happen:

@lisp
(add-hook 'find-file-hooks 'muse-mode-maybe)
@end lisp

Often you will want to publish all the files within a directory to a
particular set of output styles automatically.  To support, Muse
allows for the creation of "projects".

@node Single Project, Multiple Projects, Projects, Projects
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section A Single-Project Example
@cindex projects, single

Here is a sample project, which may be defined in your @file{.emacs}
file.

@lisp
(setq muse-project-alist
      '(("Website" ("~/Pages" :default "index")
         (:base "html" :path "~/public_html")
         (:base "pdf" :path "~/public_html/pdf"))))
@end lisp

The above defines a project named "website", whose files are located
in the directory @file{~/Pages}.  The default page to visit is
@file{index}.  When this project is published, each page will be
output as HTML to the directory @file{~/public_html}, and as PDF to
the directory @file{~/public_html/pdf}.  Within any project page, you
may create a link to other pages using the syntax @samp{[[pagename]]}.

If you would like to include only some files from a directory in a Muse
project, you may use a regexp in place of @file{~/Pages} in the example.

@node Multiple Projects, Projects and Subdirectories, Single Project, Projects
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section A Multiple-Project Example

It is possible to specify multiple projects.  Here is an example of
three projects: a generic website, a projects area, and a day-planner
(the day-planner part requires Planner Mode---see
@uref{http://wjsullivan.net/PlannerMode.html} to get it).

@lisp
(setq muse-project-alist

@section Publishing Subdirectories in Projects
@cindex projects, subdirectories

If you want to publish a directory and all of its subdirectories, Muse
provides two convenience functions that together generate the proper
rules for you.  Note that we use the backtick to begin this
muse-project-alist definition, rather than a single quote.

@lisp
(setq muse-project-alist
      `(("Website" ("~/Pages" :default "index")
         (:base "html" :path "~/public_html"))
        ("Blog" (,@@(muse-project-alist-dirs "~/Blog")
                 :default "index")
         ;; Publish this directory and its subdirectories.  Arguments
         ;; are as follows.  The above `muse-project-alist-dirs' part
         ;; is also needed.
         ;;   1. Source directory
         ;;   2. Output directory
         ;;   3. Publishing style
         ;;   remainder: Other things to put in every generated style
         ,@@(muse-project-alist-styles "~/Blog"

@end lisp

The @code{muse-project-alist-dirs} function takes a directory and
returns it and all of its subdirectories in a list.

The @code{muse-project-alist-styles} function is explained by the
comments above.

The ``blosxom'' text is the name of another publishing style, much like
``html''.  @xref{Blosxom}, for further information about it.  You can
use any publishing style you like for the third argument to
@code{muse-project-alist-styles}.

@node Options for Projects, , Projects and Subdirectories, Projects
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Listing of Available Options for Projects
@cindex projects, options
@cindex muse-project-alist, reference

This is a listing of all of the various options (or, more accurately:
attributes) that may be specified in @code{muse-project-alist}.

Each muse-project-alist entry looks like this:

@example
  (PROJECT-NAME (SOURCES)
    OUTPUTS)
@end example

We refer to these names below.

``Attributes'', which compose SOURCES and OUTPUTS, are a pair of values.
The first value is a keyword, like @option{:default}.  The second part
is the value associated with that keyword, such as the text ``index''.
If you are familiar with Emacs Lisp property lists, the concept is
similar to that, except that in the SOURCES section, single directories
can be interspersed with two-value attributes.

@subheading Project Name

This is a string that indicates the name of the project.  It is
primarily used for publishing interwiki links with the
@file{muse-wiki.el} module.

@subheading Sources

This part of a muse-project-alist entry consists of two-value
attributes, and also directory names.  If you are publishing a book, the
order of directories and attributes is significant.

The minimal content for the sources section is a list of directories.

@table @option

@item :book-chapter
Indicates a new chapter of a book.  The text of the title of the chapter
comes immediately after this keyword.

@item :book-end
Indicates the end of a book.  Directories listed after this one are
ignored when publishing a book.  The value ``t'' (without quotes) should
come immediately after this keyword.

@item :book-funcall
A function to call while publishing a book.  This is useful for doing
something just after a particular chapter.

@item :book-part
Indicates the beginning of a new part of the book.  The text of the
title should come immediately after this keyword.

@item :book-style
Indicate a particular publishing style to use for this part of the book.
If this is specified, it should come just after a @option{:part}
attribute.

@item :default
The default page to visit when browsing a project.  Also, if you are
using the @file{muse-wiki.el} module, publishing a link to just a
project's name will cause it to link to this default file.

@item :force-publish
This specifies a list of pages which should be published every time a
project is published (by using @kbd{C-c C-p}, for example), regardless
of whether their contents have changed.  This is useful for updating
Index pages, pages that use the @verb{|<include>|} tag, and other pages
that have dynamically-generated content.

@item :major-mode
This specifies the major mode to use when visiting files in this
project.  The default is @code{muse-mode}.

@item :nochapters
This indicates that while publishing a book, do not automatically create
chapters.  Values which may follow this are nil (the default, which
means that we automatically create chapters), or non-nil, which means
that we manually specify chapters with the @option{:book-chapter}
attribute,

@item :publish-project
Indicates which function we should call when publishing a project.

@item :set
This specifies a list of variables and values to set when publishing a
project.  The list should be a property list, which is in the form:

@example
(VAR1 VALUE1 VAR2 VALUE2 ...)
@end example

@item :visit-link
Specifies the function to call when visiting a link.  The default is
@code{muse-visit-link-default}.  The arguments for that function should
be (1) the link and (2) whether to visit the link in a new window.

@end table

@subheading Outputs

This part of a muse-project-alist entry is composed of lists of
attributes.  Each list is called an ``output style''.

The minimal content for an output style is a @option{:base} attribute
and a @option{:path} attribute.

@table @option

@item :base
Publishing style to use, such as ``html'', ``docbook'', or ``pdf''.

@item :base-url
An external URL which can be used to access published files.  This is
mainly used by the @file{muse-wiki} module when publishing links between
two separate projects, if the projects are served on different domains.

It is also used by the @file{muse-journal} module to create the RSS or
RDF output.

@item :exclude
Exclude items matching a regexp from being published.  The regexp should
usually begin with "/".

@item :include
Only include items matching a regexp when publishing.  The regexp should
usually begin with "/".

@item :path
The directory in which to store published files.

@item :timestamps
A file containing the timestamps (that is, time of creation) for files
in this project.  It might eventually used by the @file{muse-blosxom}
module, but this option is not currently in use by any Muse code.

@chapter Rules for Using Markup
@cindex markup

A Muse document uses special, contextual markup rules to determine how
to format the output result.  For example, if a paragraph is indented,
Muse assumes it should be quoted.

There are not too many markup rules, and all of them strive to be as
simple as possible so that you can focus on document creation, rather
than formatting.

@section Paragraphs: centering and quoting
@cindex paragraphs

Paragraphs in Muse must be separated by a blank line.

@cindex paragraphs, centered
@subheading Centered paragraphs and quotations

A line that begins with six or more columns of whitespace (either tabs
or spaces) indicates a centered paragraph.  Alternatively, you can use
the @verb{|<center>|} tag to surround regions that are to be published
as centered paragraphs.

@cindex paragraphs, quoted
@cindex quotations
But if a line begins with whitespace, though less than six columns, it
indicates a quoted paragraph.  Alternatively, you can use the
@verb{|<quote>|} tag to surround regions that are to be published as
quoted paragraphs.

@cindex examples
@cindex monospace, rendering blocks
@cindex HTML, rendering blocks in monospace
@subheading Literal paragraphs

The @verb{|<example>|} tag is used for examples, where whitespace should
be preserved, the text rendered in monospace, and any characters special
to the output style escaped.

@cindex literal text
@cindex HTML, inserting a raw block
There is also the @verb{|<literal>|} tag, which causes a marked block to
be entirely left alone.  This can be used for inserting a hand-coded
HTML blocks into HTML output, for example.

If you want some text to only be inserted when publishing to a
particular publishing style, use the @option{style} attribute for the
@verb{|<literal>|} tag.  An example follows.

@example
<literal style="latex">
A LaTeX-based style was used in the publishing of this document.
</literal>
@end example

This will leave the region alone if the current publishing style is
``latex'' or based on ``latex'', such as ``pdf'', and delete the region
otherwise.  It is also possible to leave the text alone only for one
particular style, rather than its derivations, by adding
@code{exact="t"} to the tag.

@cindex line breaks
@subheading Line breaks

If you need a line break, then use the @samp{<br>} tag.  Most of the
time this tag is unnecessary, because Muse will automatically detect
paragraphs by means of blank lines.  If you want to preserve newlines in
several lines of text, then use verse markup instead (@pxref{Verse}).

@node Headings, Directives, Paragraphs, Markup Rules
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Levels of headings
@cindex headings

A heading becomes a chapter or section in printed output -- depending on
the style.  To indicate a heading, start a new paragraph with one or
more asterices, followed by a space and the heading title.  Then begin
another paragraph to enter the text for that section.

All levels of headings will be published.  Most publishing styles only
distinguish the between the first 4 levels, however.

@example
* First level

** Second level

*** Third level

**** Fourth level
@end example

@node Directives, Emphasizing Text, Headings, Markup Rules
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Directives at the beginning of a document
@cindex directives

Directives are lines beginning with the @samp{#} character that come
before any paragraphs or sections in the document.  Directives are of
the form ``#directive content of directive''.  You can use any
combination of uppercase and lowercase letters for directives, even if
the directive is not in the list below.

The @code{muse-publishing-directive} function may be used in header and
footer text to access directives.  For example, to access the
@code{#title} directive, use @code{(muse-publishing-directive "title")}.

The following is a list of directives that Muse uses.

@table @code
@cindex #author
@item #author
The author of this document.

If this is not specified, Muse will attempt to figure it out from the
@code{user-full-name} variable.

@cindex #date
@item #date
The date that the document was last modified.

This is used by publishing styles that are able to embed the date
information.

@cindex #desc
@item #desc
A short description of this document.

This is used by the @code{journal} publishing style to embed information
inside of an RSS/RDF feed.

@cindex #title
@item #title
The title of this document.

If this is not specified, the name of the file is used.

@end table

To emphasize text, surround it with certain specially recognized
characters.

@example
*emphasis*
**strong emphasis**
***very strong emphasis***
_underlined_
=verbatim and monospace=
@end example

@cindex WYSIWYG
While editing a Muse document in Muse mode, these forms of emphasis will
be highlighted in a WYSIWYG manner.  Each of these forms may span
multiple lines.

Verbatim text will be colored as gray by default.  To change this,
customize @code{muse-verbatim-face}.

You can also use the @verb{|<code>|} tag to indicate verbatim and
monospace text.  This is handy for regions that have an ``='' in them.

@node Footnotes, Verse, Emphasizing Text, Markup Rules

@section Making notes to be shown at the end
@cindex footnotes

A footnote reference is simply a number in square brackets.  To define
the footnote, place this definition at the bottom of your file.
@samp{footnote-mode} can be used to greatly facilitate the creation of
these kinds of footnotes.

Footnotes are defined by the same number in brackets occurring at the
beginning of a line.  Use footnote-mode's @kbd{C-c ! a} command, to very
easily insert footnotes while typing.  Use @kbd{C-x C-x} to return to
the point of insertion.

@node Verse, Lists, Footnotes, Markup Rules
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Indicating poetic stanzas
@cindex verses
@cindex poetry

Poetry requires that whitespace be preserved, but without resorting to
monospace.  To indicate this, use the following markup, reminiscent of
email quotations.

@example
> A line of Emacs verse;
>   forgive its being so terse.
@end example

You can also use the @verb{|<verse>|} tag, if you prefer.

@example
<verse>
A line of Emacs verse;
  forgive its being so terse.
</verse>
@end example

@cindex verses, multiple stanzas
Multiple stanzas may be included in one set of @verb{|<verse>|} tags, as
follows.

@example
<verse>
A line of Emacs verse;
  forgive its being so terse.

In terms of terse verse,
  you could do worse.
</verse>
@end example

@node Lists, Tables, Verse, Markup Rules

@section Lists of items
@cindex lists

Lists are given using special characters at the beginning of a line.
Whitespace must occur before bullets or numbered items, to distinguish
from the possibility of those characters occurring in a real sentence.

@cindex lists, bullets
These are rendered as a bullet list.

@example
Normal text.

 - bullet item one
 - bullet item two
@end example

@cindex lists, enumerated
An enumerated list follows.

@example
Normal text.

 1. Enum item one
 2. Enum item two
@end example

@cindex lists, definitions
Here is a definition list.

@example
Term1 ::
  This is a first definition
  And it has two lines;
  no, make that three.

Term2 :: This is a second definition
@end example

@subheading Nested lists

@cindex lists, nested
It is possible to nest lists of the same or different kinds.  The
``level'' of the list is determined by the amount of initial whitespace.

@example
Normal text.

 - Level 1, bullet item one
   1. Level 2, enum item one
   2. Level 2, enum item two
 - Level 1, bullet item two
   1. Level 2, enum item three
   2. Level 2, enum item four
      term :: definition
@end example

@subheading Breaking list items

@cindex lists, breaking lines
If you want to break up a line within any list type, just put one blank
line between the end of the previous line and the beginning of the next
line, using the same amount of initial indentation.

@example
 - bullet item 1, line 1

   bullet item 1, line 2

   1. Enum line 1

      Enum line 2

 - bullet item 2, line 1

   bullet item 2, line 2
@end example

@node Tables, Explicit Links, Lists, Markup Rules

@cindex tables, simple
Only very simple tables are supported.  The syntax is as follows.

@example
Double bars  || Separate header fields

Single bars   | Separate body fields
Here are more | body fields

Triple bars ||| Separate footer fields
@end example

Some publishing styles require header fields to come first, then footer
fields, and then the body fields.  You can use any order for these
sections that you like, and Muse will re-order them for you at
publish-time.

If you wish to disable table generation for one Muse file, add the
directive @samp{#disable-tables t} to the top of the file.

@subheading Other table formats

@cindex tables, orgtbl-mode style
It is possible to publish very basic Orgtbl-mode style tables.

@example
| org  | style | table |
|------+-------+-------|
| one  |       | one   |
| two  | two   |       |
|      | three | three |
|------+-------+-------|
| more | stuff |       |
@end example

If you are used to the way that Org Mode publishes these tables, then
customize `muse-html-table-attributes' to the following, in order to get
a similar kind of output.

@example
border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides"
@end example

@cindex tables, table.el style
@file{table.el} style tables are also supported, as long as
@file{table.el} itself supports outputting tables for a particular
publishing style.  At the time of this writing, the ``html'', ``latex'',
and ``docbook'' styles are supported by @file{table.el}.  Styles derived
from these styles will also work.

@example
+---+-----+---+
|   | one | 1 |
+---+-----+---+
| b | two |   |
+---+-----+---+
| c |     | 3 |
+---+-----+---+

@cindex links, explicit

A hyperlink can reference a URL, or another page within a Muse
project.  In addition, descriptive text can be specified, which should
be displayed rather than the link text in output styles that supports
link descriptions.  The syntax is as follows.

@example
[[link target][link description]]
[[link target without description]]
@end example

Thus, the current maintainer's homepage for Muse can be found
@samp{[[http://mwolson.org/projects/EmacsMuse.html][here]]},
or at @samp{[[http://mwolson.org/projects/EmacsMuse.html]]}.

@section Bare URLs, WikiNames, and InterWiki links
@cindex links, implicit
@cindex links, raw

@cindex URLs
@cindex Email addresses

A URL or email address encountered in the input text is published as a
hyperlink.  These kind of links are called @dfn{implicit links} because
they are not separated from the rest of the Muse document in any way.

Some characters in URLs will prevent Muse from recognizing them as
implicit links. If you want to link to a URL containing spaces or any of
the characters ``][,"'`()<>^'', you will have to make the link
explicit. The punctuation characters ``.,;:'' are also not recognized as
part of a URL when they appear at its end. For information on how to
make an explicit link, see @ref{Explicit Links,,Hyperlinks and email
addresses with descriptions}.

@cindex WikiNames
If the @command{muse-wiki} module is loaded, another form of implicit
link will be made available.  WikiNames, which are typed in CamelCase,
are highlighted and published as links, provided that the file they
refer to exists.

Customization of WikiName recognition may be accomplished by editing the
@code{muse-wiki-wikiword-regexp} option and subsequently running
@code{(muse-configure-highlighting 'muse-colors-markupmuse-colors-markup)}.
If you use the Customize interface, the latter will be done
automatically.

@cindex InterWiki links
@cindex inter-project links
The @command{muse-wiki} module also allows for InterWiki links.  These
are similar to WikiWords, but they specify both the project and page of
a file.  The names of your project entries in @code{muse-project-alist}
will be used as InterWiki names by default.  Several examples follow.

@example
Blog::DocumentingMuse
Projects#EmacsMuse
Website
@end example

In the first case, the interwiki delimiter is @samp{::}, @samp{Blog} is
the project name, and @samp{DocumentingMuse} is the page name.  In the
second example, @samp{#} is the interwiki delimiter.  If the name of a
project occurs by itself in text, like the third case, it will be
colorized and published as a link to the default page of the given
project.

Customization of interwiki links may be accomplished by editing the
@code{muse-wiki-interwiki-alist} option.

It is also possible to link to an anchor in an interwiki document.  This
is called a ``three-part link''.  Examples of this follow.

@example
Blog::DocumentingMuse#anchor1
Projects#EmacsMuse#anchor2
@end example

@section Publishing and displaying images

@cindex links, with images
@subheading Image links

Links to images may be used in either the target or the description, or
both.  Thus, the following code will publish as a clickable image that
points to @url{http://mwolson.org/}.

@example
[[http://mwolson.org/][/static/logos/site-logo.png]]
@end example

Normally, images in the link part will be inlined.

If you want these images to be published as links instead, place the
text ``URL:'' immediately in front of the link text.  An example
follows.

@example
[[URL:http://mwolson.org/static/logos/site-logo.png]]
@end example

@cindex images, displaying
@cindex images, local
@subheading Displaying images in Muse mode
If a link to a locally-available image is encountered in the link
description, Muse mode will attempt to display it if your version of
Emacs permits this.

This behavior may be toggled with @kbd{C-c C-i}, or disabled permanently
by setting the @code{muse-colors-inline-images} option to @code{nil}.

The method for finding images may be altered by customizing the
@code{muse-colors-inline-image-method} option.  One useful value for
this option is @code{muse-colors-use-publishing-directory}, which tells
Muse mode to look in the directory where the current file will be
published.  The default is to look in the current directory.  Relative
paths like @samp{../pics/} should work for either setting.

Eventually, it is hoped that Muse will be able to copy images from the a
``source'' directory to a publishing directory by customizing
@code{muse-project-alist}, but this has not been implemented yet.

@cindex images, without descriptions
@cindex images, inlined
@subheading Publishing simple images
The following example will display correctly and publish correctly if a
@acronym{PNG} file called @file{TestLogo.png} exists in the
@file{../pics/} directory.  If text is on the same line as the picture,
it will remain so in the output.

@example
[[../myimage.png]]
@end example

@cindex images, captions
@subheading Publishing images with captions
If you want to add a caption to an image, use the following syntax.
This will center the image (if the output format supports it) and add a
centered caption below the picture.  Formats that do not support
centering the image will instead leave it against the left margin.

@example
[[../pics/mycat.png][My cat Dexter]]

Images with captions may only occur in their own paragraphs, with no

Arbitrary kinds of markup can be achieved using the @verb{|<lisp>|} tag.
With the @verb{|<lisp>|} tag, you may generate whatever output text you
wish.  The inserted output will get marked up if the @verb{|<lisp>|}
tag appears within the main text of the document.

@example
<lisp>(concat "This form gets " "inserted")</lisp>
@end example

@cindex lisp, and insert command
Note that you should not use the @code{insert} command within a set of
@verb{|<lisp>|} tags, since the return value from the @verb{|<lisp>|}
tags will be automatically inserted into the document.

It is also possible to treat the output as if it were surrounded by the
@verb{|<example>|}, @verb{|<src>|}, or @verb{|<verse>|} tags, by
specifying ``example'', ``src'', or ``verse'' as the @option{markup}
attribute of the @verb{|<lisp>|} tag.

@example
<lisp markup="example">
(concat "Insert" " me")
</lisp>
@end example

Other languages also have tags that cause source code to be evaluated.

@subheading Example

Here is an example of what citations look like in a Muse document.

@example
#bibsource REFDB

* Title
** Subtitle

Some text before <cite>Miller1999</cite> and after the citation.

This is an author-only citation <cite type="author">Miller1999</cite>.

And this is a year-only citation <cite type="year">Miller1999</cite>.

Finally, this is a multi-head citation
<cite>Miller1999,Andrews2005</cite>.
@end example

@subheading Overview

The @code{#bibsource} directive defines the source of the
bibliographies.  The following sources are possible.

@itemize @bullet
@item DocBook + RefDB:
the string "REFDB"

@item LaTeX + bibtex:
the name of an appropriate bibtex file

@item LaTeX + RefDB:
if the input file is called "foo.muse", then set this to "foo.bib"
@end itemize

Citations are encoded as @verb{|<cite>|} elements which enclose the
citation keys as they are defined in the bibliography file or database.
In multi-head citations, the citation keys have to be separated by
colons or semicolons.  The @code{latex} and @code{docbook} styles
translate these to the proper separator automatically.

The @verb{|<cite>|} elements take an optional ``type'' attribute that
defines how the citation is rendered.  If the attribute is missing,
you'll get a regular citation according to the bibliography style,
e.g.'' (Miller et al., 1999)''.  If the attribute is set to "author",
only the name of the author(s) will be rendered.  Accordingly, "year"
will cause the year to be printed.  This is useful to create citations
like this:

@example
Miller et al. had already shown in a previous publication (1999) that
this is not going to work.
@end example

Remember that refdb-mode (the Emacs interface to RefDB) can retrieve
references by simply marking the citation key and running the
@code{refdb-getref-by-field-on-region} command.  Later versions of
@code{refdb-mode} will also allow to insert references as Muse citations
(which is already implemented for DocBook, TEI, and LaTeX documents).

You may have noticed that there is no element to indicate the position
of the bibliography.  The latter is always created at a valid position
close to the end of the document.  The functions
@code{muse-docbook-bibliography} and @code{muse-latex-bibliography} are
called in the header or footer to generate this content, so it is
possible to change the exact position.

That is, only a semi-colon at the beginning of a line, followed by a
literal space, will cause that line to be treated as a comment.

You can alternatively surround the region with the @verb{|<comment>|}
tag.

If you wish the comment to be published, but just commented out using
the comment syntax of the output format, then set
@option{muse-publish-comments-p} to non-nil.

Muse has several built-in tags that may prove useful during publishing.
@xref{muse-publish-markup-tags}, to see how to customize the tags that
Muse uses, as well as make your own tags.

Only a small subset of these tags are available in header and footer
text.  The @code{muse-publish-markup-header-footer-tags} option lists
the tags that are allowed in headers and footers.

@subheading Syntax

If a tag takes arguments, it will look like this, where ``tagname'' is
the name of the tag.

@example
<tagname arg1="string1" arg2="string2">
@end example

If you want the tag to look like it came straight from an XHTML
document, you can alternatively do the following.

@example
<tagname arg1="string1" arg2="string2" />
@end example

If a tag surrounds some text, it will look like this.

@example
<tagname>Some text</tagname>
@end example

If a tag surrounds a large region, it will look like this.

@example
<tagname>
Some text.
Some more text.
</tagname>
@end example

@subheading Tag listing

This is the complete list of tags that Muse accepts, including those
that were mentioned in previous sections.

@table @samp

@item <br>
Insert a line break.

Muse will automatically detect paragraphs when publishing by means of
blank lines, so this tag is usually unnecessary.

@item <cite>
Insert a citation to another source.

This takes the argument @option{type}, which indicates the type of
citation.  The valid types are "author" and "year".  If this argument is
omitted, include both author and year in the citation.

The bibliography to use for the citation may be specified by the
@option{#bibsource} directive.

@xref{Citations}, for additional information.

@item <class>
If publishing to HTML, surround the given text with a @verb{|<span>|}
tag.  It takes one argument called ``name'' that specifies the ``class''
attribute of the @verb{|<span>|} tag.

If publishing to a different format, do nothing extra to the text.

@item <code>
Treat the text surrounded by the tag as if they were enclosed in equal
signs, that is, make it monospace.

@item <command>
Run a command on the region, replacing the region with the result of the
command.  The command is specified with the ``interp'' argument.  If no
value for ``interp'' is given, pass the entire region to the shell.

The ``markup'' argument controls how this section is marked up.

If it is omitted, publish the region with the normal Muse rules.

If "nil", do not mark up the region at all, but prevent Muse from
further interpreting it.

If "example", treat the region as if it was surrounded by the
@verb{|<example>|} tag.

If "src", treat the included text as if it was surrounded by the
@verb{|<src>|} tag.  You should also specify the ``lang'' attribute if
doing this.

If "verse", treat the region as if it was surrounded by the
@verb{|<verse>|} tag, to preserve newlines.

Otherwise, it should be the name of a function to call, with the buffer
narrowed to the region.

@item <comment>
Treat the entire region as a comment.  If the option
@var{muse-publish-comments-p} is nil, delete the region, otherwise
publish it using the comment syntax of the current publishing style.

@item <contents>
Publish a Table of Contents.  This will either be inserted in-place or
at the beginning of the document, depending on your publishing style.
It does not have a delimiting tag.

By default, only 2 levels of headings will be included in the generated
Table of Contents.  To change this globally, customize the
@var{muse-publish-contents-depth} option.  To change this only for the
current tag, use the ``depth'' argument.

@item <div>
Insert a <div> tag into HTML documents, and do not insert anything
special for other non-HTML publishing formats.

If the ``style'' argument is provided, include it with the published
@verb{|<div>|} tag.  Likewise for the ``id'' argument.

@item <example>
Publish the region in monospace, preserving the newlines in the region.
This is useful for snippets of code.

@item <include>
Insert the given file at the current location during publishing.  The
basic use of this tag is as follows, replacing ``included_file'' with
the name of the file that you want to include.

@example
<include file="included_file">
@end example

The ``markup'' argument controls how this section is marked up.

If it is omitted, publish the included text with the normal Muse
rules.

If "nil", do not mark up the included text at all.

If "example", treat the included text as if it was surrounded by the
@verb{|<example>|} tag.

If "src", treat the included text as if it was surrounded by the
@verb{|<src>|} tag.  You should also specify the ``lang'' attribute if
doing this.

If "verse", treat the included text as if it was surrounded by the
@verb{|<verse>|} tag, to preserve newlines.

Otherwise, it should be the name of a function to call after inserting
the file with the buffer narrowed to the section inserted.

@item <lisp>
Evaluate the Emacs Lisp expressions between the initial and ending tags.
The result is then inserted into the document, so you do not need to
explicitly call @code{insert}.  All text properties are removed from the
resulting text.

This tag takes the ``markup'' argument.  See the description of
@verb{|<command>|} for details.

@item <literal>
Make sure that the text enclosed by this tag is published without
escaping it in any way.  This is useful for inserting markup directly
into the published document, when Muse does not provide the desired
functionality.

@item <markup>
Mark up the text between the initial and ending tags.  The markup
command to use may be specified by the ``function'' argument.  The
standard Muse markup routines are used by default if no ``function''
argument is provided.

This is useful for marking up regions in headers and footers.  One
example that comes to mind is generating a published index of all of the
files in the current project by doing the following.

@example
<markup><lisp>(muse-index-as-string t t)</lisp></markup>
@end example

@item <perl>
Run the @command{perl} language interpreter on the region, replacing the
region with the result of the command.

This tag takes the ``markup'' argument.  See the description of
@verb{|<command>|} for details.

@item <python>
Run the @command{python} language interpreter on the region, replacing
the region with the result of the command.

This tag takes the ``markup'' argument.  See the description of
@verb{|<command>|} for details.

@item <quote>
Publish the region as a blockquote.  This will either be inserted
in-place or at the beginning of the document, depending on your
publishing style.  It does not have a delimiting tag.

@item <ruby>
Run the @command{ruby} language interpreter on the region, replacing the
region with the result of the command.

This tag takes the ``markup'' argument.  See the description of
@verb{|<command>|} for details.

@item <src>
Publish the region using htmlize.
The language to use may be specified by the ``lang'' attribute.

Muse will look for a function named @var{lang}-mode, where @var{lang} is
the value of the ``lang'' attribute.

This tag requires htmlize 1.34 or later in order to work.  If this is
not satisfied, or the current publishing style is not HTML-based, Muse
will publish the region like an @verb{|<example>|} tag.

@item <verbatim>
This is used when you want to prevent Muse from trying to interpret some
markup.  Surround the markup in @verb{|<verbatim>|} and
@verb{|</verbatim>|}, and it will not be interpreted.

This tag was used often in previous versions of Muse because they did
not support whole-document escaping of specials.  Now, it will only be
needed for other tags, and perhaps footnotes as well.

@item <verse>
Preserve the newlines in the region.  In formats like HTML, newlines are
removed by default, hence the need for this tag.  In other publishing
styles, this tag may cause the text to be indented slightly in a way
that looks nice for poetry and prose.

@subsection Other tools needed for the Blosxom style

You will need to have @command{pyblosxom.cgi} or @command{blosxom.cgi}
installed on a machine that you have upload access to.

The major difficulty in both of these programs is specifying the date of
the entries.  Both programs rely on the file modification time rather
than any data contained in the entries themselves.  A plugin is needed
in order for these programs to be able to get the correct date.

@subheading PyBlosxom

There are two different ways of accomplishing this in pyblosxom.  The
first way involves gathering the timestamps (as specified by the
@code{#date} directive) into one file and then sending that file along
with published entries to the webserver.

The second will read each file at render time and parse the
@code{#postdate} directive.  Muse will translate the @code{#date}
directive into @code{#postdate} at publish time, so you don't have to do
any extra work.

@subsubheading Placing timestamps in one file

The following additional components are required in order to make the
date of blog entries display as something sensible.

@enumerate
@item
A script to gather date directives from the entire blog tree into a
single file.  The file must associate a blog entry with a date.

@item
A plugin for (py)blosxom that reads this file.
@end enumerate

These 2 things are provided for @command{pyblosxom.cgi} in the
@file{contrib/pyblosxom} subdirectory.  @file{getstamps.py} provides the
former service, while @file{hardcodedates.py} provides the latter
service.

Here is a sample listing from my @file{timestamps} file, which maps
each file to a date.  This can really be in any format, as long as your
date-gathering script and your plugin can both understand it.

@example
2005-04-01-14-16 personal/paper_cranes
2005-03-21 personal/spring_break_over
2004-10-24 personal/finished_free_culture
@end example

The script @file{contrib/pyblosxom/make-blog} demonstrates how to call
@file{getstamps.py}.  Note that you will need to set the current
directory to where your Muse files are, execute @file{getstamps.py}, and
then move the generated timestamps file to your publishing directory.

@subsubheading Getting timestamp from entry while rendering

Alternately, the pyblosxom metadate plugin may be used.  On the plus
side, there is no need to run a script to gather the date.  On the
downside, each entry is read twice rather than once when the page is
rendered.  Set the value of @code{muse-blosxom-use-metadate} to non-nil
to enable adding a @code{#postdate} directive to all published files.
You can do this by:

@example
M-x customize-variable RET muse-blosxom-use-metadate RET
@end example

With the metadate plugin installed in pyblosxom, the date set in this
directive will be used instead of the file's modification time.  The
plugin is included with Muse at @file{contrib/pyblosxom/metadate.py}.

@subheading Blosxom

It is also possible to use Blosxom, which is written in Perl, to serve
blog entries that were published with Muse.  The steps are as follows.

@enumerate
@item
Download and install blosxom from @url{http://blosxom.sourceforge.net/}.

@item
Install the metadate plugin.  It is available in
@file{contrib/blosxom/metadate_0_0_3}.

@item
Every time you make a new blog entry, change to the blosxom data
directory and execute the @file{contrib/blosxom/getstamps.pl} script.
This script has only recently been made, and may still have some bugs,
so use with caution.

@end enumerate

@node Blosxom Entries, Blosxom Options, Blosxom Requirements, Blosxom
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@subsection Format of a Blosxom entry and automation

Each Blosxom file must include `#date yyyy-mm-dd', or optionally the
longer `#date yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm', a title (using the @code{#title}
directive), plus whatever normal content is desired.

The date directive is not used directly by @command{pyblosxom.cgi} or
this program.  You need to have the two additional items from the former
section to make use of this feature.

There is a function called @code{muse-blosxom-new-entry} that will
automate the process of making a new blog entry.  To make use of it, do
the following.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Customize @code{muse-blosxom-base-directory} to the location that your
blog entries are stored.

@item
Assign the @code{muse-blosxom-new-entry} function to a key sequence.  I
use the following code to assign this function to @kbd{C-c p l'}.

@example
(global-set-key "\C-cpl" 'muse-blosxom-new-entry)
@end example

@item
You should create your directory structure ahead of time under your base
directory.  These directories, which correspond with category names, may
be nested.

@item
When you enter this key sequence, you will be prompted for the category
of your entry and its title.  Upon entering this information, a new file
will be created that corresponds with the title, but in lowercase
letters and having special characters converted to underscores.  The
title and date directives will be inserted automatically.

@section Publishing entries into a compilation

This publishing style is used to output ``books'' in LaTeX or PDF
format.

Each page will become a separate chapter in the book, unless the style
keyword @option{:nochapters} is used, in which case they are all run
together as if one giant chapter.

One way of publishing a book is to make a project for it, add the
project to @code{muse-project-alist}, and use the @code{book-pdf} style
with a very specific @option{:include} value to specify some page whose
contents will be checked for the values of @code{#title} and
@code{#date}, and whose name will be used in the output file.  Then to
publish the book, visit the aforementioned page and use @kbd{C-c C-t} or
@kbd{C-c C-p} to trigger the publishing process.  An example
@code{muse-project-alist} for this method follows.

@example
(setq muse-project-alist
      '(("MyNotes" (:nochapters t  ; do automatically add chapters
                    :book-chapter "Computer Science"
                    "~/Notes/cs"
                    :book-chapter "Mathematics"
                    "~/Notes/math"
                    :book-chapter "Emacs"
                    "~/Notes/emacs"
                    :book-end t ; the rest will not be placed in the book
                    "~/Notes"   ; so we can find the notes-anthology page
                    "~/Notes/private"
                    :force-publish ("index")
                    :default "index")
         (:base "book-pdf"
                :include "/notes-anthology[^/]*$"
                :path "~/public_html/notes")
         ;; other publishing styles for each directory go here,
         ;; if desired
         )))
@end example

In this example, there would be a file called
@file{~/Notes/notes-anthology.muse}, which would contain just the
following.  The resulting book would be published to
@file{~/public_html/notes/notes-anthology.pdf}.

@example
#title My Technology Ramblings
@end example

Another way is to call the @code{muse-book-publish-project} function
manually, with a custom project entry.  An example of this may be found
in John Wiegley's configuration file at
@file{examples/johnw/muse-init.el}, in the @code{muse-publish-my-books}
function.

work with documents published in both HTML and ConTeXt, we need to
ignore the @verb{|<contents>|} tag.

If you don't agree with this, then set this option to non-nil,
and it will do what you expect.

@section Integrating with ikiwiki

Note: Support for Ikiwiki is not yet complete.  Use at your own risk.

Ikiwiki is a wiki compiler (@url{http://ikiwiki.info/}).  Emacs Muse can
(not yet) be used as a source format for Ikiwiki pages with the plugin
@file{IkiWiki::Plugin::muse}.

The @file{lisp/muse-ikiwiki.el} file provides publishing functions and
styles for Ikiwiki.  The plugin for Ikiwiki to recognize Muse files is
provided by the @file{contrib/ikiwiki/IkiWiki/Plugin/muse.pm} file.  Two
sample init files are available in the @file{examples/ikiwiki}
directory.  Configure your @file{ikiwiki.setup} file so that the
@code{muse_init} variable has the location of your Muse init file.

If you are using CGI, The directory @file{contrib/ikiwiki/IkiWiki} must
be copied to the same directory as the CGI script that Ikiwiki
generates.  When publishing your wiki, the @var{PERL5LIB} environment
variable must contain the path to the @file{contrib/ikiwiki/IkiWiki}
directory.

@section Keeping a journal or blog
@cindex journal
@cindex blog, journal style

The module facilitates the keeping and publication of a journal.  When
publishing to HTML, it assumes the form of a web log, or blog.

The input format for each entry is as follows.

@example
* 20040317: Title of entry

text for the entry.

<qotd>
"You know who you are. It comes down to a simple gut check: You
either love what you do or you don't. Period." -- P. Bronson
</qotd>
@end example

The "qotd", or Quote of the Day, is entirely optional.  When generated
to HTML, this entry is rendered as the following.

@example
<div class="entry">
  <div class="entry-qotd">
    <h3>Quote of the Day:</h3>
    <p>"You know who you are. It comes down to a simple gut
      check: You either love what you do or you don't. Period."
      -- P. Bronson</p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry-body">
    <div class="entry-head">
      <div class="entry-date">
        <span class="date">March 17, 2004</span>
      </div>
      <div class="entry-title">
        <h2>Title of entry</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-text">
      <p>Text for the entry.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
@end example

The plurality of "div" tags makes it possible to display the entries in
any form you wish, using a CSS style.

Also, an .RDF file can be generated from your journal by publishing it
with the "rdf" style.  It uses the first two sentences of the first
paragraph of each entry as its "description", and auto-generates tags
for linking to the various entries.

@subheading muse-project-alist considerations

If you wish to publish an RDF or RSS feed, it is important to include
the @option{:base-url} attribute in your @code{muse-project-alist} entry
for your Journal projects.  An example follows.

@example
(setq muse-project-alist
      '(("Journal" ("~/Journal/"
                    :default "journal")
        (:base "journal-rss"
               :base-url "http://example.org/journal/"

@section Publishing LaTeX documents

This publishing style is capable of producing LaTeX or PDF documents.

If you wish to publish PDF documents, you will need to have a good LaTeX
installation.  For Debian and Ubuntu, this can be accomplished by
installing the ``tetex-bin'' and ``tetex-extra'' packages.  TeX fonts
are also a must.

If your LaTeX installation has the file @file{grffile.sty}, which may be
found in the @file{texlive-latex-recommended} package for Debian and
Ubuntu, then consider using it by adding the following to your header
file.  This allows spaces in filenames to work.

@section Publish a poem to LaTeX or PDF

The @code{muse-poem} module makes it easy to attractively publish and
reference poems in the following format, using the "memoir" module for
LaTeX publishing.  It will also markup poems for every other output
style, though none are nearly as pretty.

@example
Title


Body of poem


Annotations, history, notes, etc.
@end example

Once a poem is written in this format, just publish it to PDF using the
@code{poem-pdf} style.  To make an inlined reference to a poem that
you've written -- for example, from a blog page -- there is a "poem" tag
defined by this module.

@example
<poem title="name.of.poem.page">
@end example

Let's assume the template above was called @file{name.of.poem.page};
then the above tag would result in this inclusion.

@example
** Title

> Body of poem

@code{muse-publish-markup-functions}

An alist of style types to custom functions for that kind of text.

This is used by publishing styles to attempt to minimize the amount of
custom regexps that each has to define.  @file{muse-publish} provides
rules for the most common types of markup.

Each member of the list is of the following form.

@example
(SYMBOL FUNCTION)
@end example

@itemize @bullet
@item SYMBOL
Describes the type of text to associate with this rule.
@code{muse-publish-markup-regexps} maps regexps to these symbols.

@item FUNCTION
Function to use to mark up this kind of rule if no suitable function is
found through the @option{:functions} tag of the current style.

@cindex publishing, rules

@anchor{muse-publish-markup-regexps}
@code{muse-publish-markup-regexps}

List of markup rules for publishing a page with Muse.

The rules given in this variable are invoked first, followed by whatever
rules are specified by the current style.

Each member of the list is either a function, or a list of the following
form.

@example
(REGEXP/SYMBOL TEXT-BEGIN-GROUP REPLACEMENT-TEXT/FUNCTION/SYMBOL)
@end example

@itemize @bullet
@item REGEXP
A regular expression, or symbol whose value is a regular expression,
which is searched for using `re-search-forward'.

@item TEXT-BEGIN-GROUP
The matching group within that regexp which denotes the beginning of the
actual text to be marked up.

@item REPLACEMENT-TEXT
A string that will be passed to `replace-match'.

If it is not a string, but a function, it will be called to determine
what the replacement text should be (it must return a string).  If it is
a symbol, the value of that symbol should be a string.
@end itemize

The replacements are done in order, one rule at a time.  Writing
the regular expressions can be a tricky business.  Note that case
is never ignored.  `case-fold-search' is always bound to nil
while processing the markup rules.

@subheading Publishing order

This is the order that the publishing rules are consulted, by default.
This may be changed by customizing @code{muse-publish-markup-regexps}.

@section Tag specifications for special markup
@cindex publishing, markup tags

@anchor{muse-publish-markup-tags}
@code{muse-publish-markup-tags}

A list of tag specifications, for specially marking up text.

XML-style tags are the best way to add custom markup to Muse.  This is
easily accomplished by customizing this list of markup tags.

For each entry, the name of the tag is given, whether it expects a
closing tag and/or an optional set of attributes, whether it is
nestable, and a function that performs whatever action is desired within
the delimited region.

The tags themselves are deleted during publishing, before the function
is called.  The function is called with three arguments, the beginning
and end of the region surrounded by the tags.  If properties are
allowed, they are passed as a third argument in the form of an alist.
The `end' argument to the function is always a marker.

Point is always at the beginning of the region within the tags, when the
function is called.  Wherever point is when the function finishes is
where tag markup will resume.

These tag rules are processed once at the beginning of markup, and once
at the end, to catch any tags which may have been inserted in-between.

(@pxref{Deriving Styles}) to create a new style.

@defun muse-define-style name &rest elements
@end defun

@subheading Usable elements

@table @option

@item :suffix
File extension to use for publishing files with this style.

@item :link-suffix
File extension to use for publishing links to Muse files with this
style.

@item :osuffix
File extension to use for publishing second-stage files with this style.

For example, PDF publishing generates a LaTeX file first, then a PDF
from that LaTeX file.

@item :regexps
List of markup rules for publishing a page with Muse.
@xref{muse-publish-markup-regexps}.

@item :functions

These cover the most basic kinds of markup, the handling of which
differs little between the various styles.

@item :tags
A list of tag specifications, used for handling extra tags.
@xref{muse-publish-markup-tags}.

@item :specials
A table of characters which must be represented specially.

@item :before
A function that is to be executed on the newly-created publishing buffer
(or the current region) before any publishing occurs.

This is used to set extra parameters that direct the publishing process.

@item :before-end
A function that is to be executed on the publishing buffer (or the
current region) immediately after applying all of the markup regexps.

This is used to fix the order of table elements (header, footer, body)
in XML-ish styles.

@item :after
A function that is to be executed on the publishing buffer after
:before-end, and immediately after inserting the header and footer.

This is used for generating the table of contents as well as setting the
file coding system.

@item :final
A function that is to be executed after saving the published file, but
while still in its buffer.

This is used for generating second-stage documents like PDF files from
just-published LaTeX files.

The function must accept three arguments: the name of the muse source
file, the name of the just-published file, and the name of the
second-stage target file.  The name of the second-stage target file is
the same as that of the just-published file if no second-stage
publishing is required.

@item :header
Header used for publishing files of this style.

This may be a variable, text, or a filename.  It is inserted at the
beginning of a file, after evaluating the publishing markup.

@item :footer
Footer used for publishing files of this style.

This may be a variable, text, or a filename.  It is inserted at the end
of a file, after evaluating the publishing markup.

@item :style-sheet
Style sheet used for publishing files of this style.

This may be a variable or text.  It is used in the header of HTML and
XHTML based publishing styles.

@item :browser
The function used to browse the published result of files of this style.

To create a new style from an existing one, use @code{muse-derive-style}
as follows.  This is a good way to fix something you don't like about a
particular publishing style, or to personalize it.

@defun muse-derive-style new-name base-name &rest elements
@end defun

The derived name is a string defining the new style, such as "my-html".
The base name must identify an existing style, such as "html" -- if you
have loaded @file{muse-html}.  The style parameters are the same as
those used to create a style, except that they override whatever
definitions exist in the base style.  However, some definitions only
partially override.  The following parameters support partial
overriding.

@table @option

@item :functions
If a markup function is not found in the derived style's function list,

@item :strings
If a markup string is not found in the derived style's string list, the
base style's string list will be queried.

@end menu

@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Edit lists easily in other major modes
@cindex muse-list-edit-minor-mode

@code{muse-list-edit-minor-mode} is meant to be used with other major
modes, such as Message (for composing email) and debian-changelog-mode
(for editing debian/changelog files).

It implements practically perfect support for editing and filling lists.
It can even handle nested lists.  In addition to Muse-specific list
items ("-", numbers, definition lists, footnotes), it can also handle
items that begin with "*" or "+".  Filling list items behaves in the
same way that it does in Muse, regardless of whether filladapt is also
enabled, which is the primary reason to use this tool.

@subheading Installation

To use it, add ``(require 'muse-mode)'' to your Emacs customization file
and add the function @code{turn-on-muse-list-edit-minor-mode} to any
mode hooks where you wish to enable this minor mode.

@subheading Keybindings

@code{muse-list-edit-minor-mode} uses the following keybindings.

@table @kbd

@item M-RET (`muse-l-e-m-m-insert-list-item')
Insert a new list item at point, using the indentation level of the
current list item.

@item C-< (`muse-l-e-m-m-decrease-list-item-indent')
Decrease indentation of the current list item.

@item C-> (`muse-l-e-m-m-increase-list-item-indent')
Increase indentation of the current list item.

@end table

@subheading Functions

@defun muse-list-edit-minor-mode
This is a global minor mode for editing files with lists.
It is meant to be used with other major modes, and not with Muse mode.

Interactively, with no prefix argument, toggle the mode.
With universal prefix @var{arg} turn mode on.
With zero or negative @var{arg} turn mode off.

This minor mode provides the Muse keybindings for editing lists,
and support for filling lists properly.

It recognizes not only Muse-style lists, which use the "-"
character or numbers, but also lists that use asterisks or plus
signs.  This should make the minor mode generally useful.

Definition lists and footnotes are also recognized.

Note that list items may omit leading spaces, for compatibility
with modes that set @code{left-margin}, such as
@code{debian-changelog-mode}.
@end defun

@defun turn-on-muse-list-edit-minor-mode
Unconditionally turn on Muse list edit minor mode.
@end defun

@defun turn-off-muse-list-edit-minor-mode

@itemize
@item 2004
John Wiegley started Muse upon realizing that EmacsWiki had some serious
limitations. Around February 2004, he started making "emacs-wiki version
3.00 APLHA", which eventually became known as Muse.

Most of those who frequent the emacs-wiki mailing list continued to use
emacs-wiki, mainly because Planner hasn't been ported over to it.

As of 2004-12-01, Michael Olson became the maintainer of Muse, as per
John Wiegley's request.

@item 2005
Michael Olson overhauled this document and added many new sections in
preparation for the first release of Muse (3.01).
