;;; Commentary:

;; Uses the tool "highlight", and the system utility "pbcopy" to copy the
;; selected region (or the current buffer) as RTF to the system pasteboard.
;;
;; I bind this to M-a-w, or Cmd-Option-W on my Mac.  It's great for getting
;; code from Emacs into Keynote as highlighted text with leading line numbers.
;;
;; The command `copy-code-as-rtf' also accepts prefix and numerical arguments:
;;
;;   C-u M-x copy-code-as-rtf        Don't use prefixed line numbers
;;   M-24 M-x copy-code-as-rtf       Use a font-size of 24pt
;;   M-- M-24 M-x copy-code-as-rtf   Use a font-size of 24pt, and no linnums
