;;; Commentary:

;; Here's how these scoring rules work:
;;
;;  - If you type 'c y' to catch-up a group and don't read certain
;;    threads at all, you should never see those threads again (unless
;;    some manual scoring rule applies in the future, or an author in
;;    the thread gets boosted later because you keep reading his or her
;;    posts).
;;
;;  - Use 'I A', 'I S' or 'I T' to manually boost authors, subjects and
;;    threads.  This interacts well with adaptive scoring, and guides
;;    it.
;;
;;  - If you dormant (?) an article, the subject *and* the author get a
;;    small boost.  But be aware that if dormant one article in a large
;;    thread, but don't read any of the other articles, you'll likely
;;    still not see that thread in future.
;;
;;  - If you tick (!) an article, the subject is boosted the same as if
;;    you read the article (using SPC).
;;
;;  - If you delete an article (using 'd'), the subject gets dinged the
;;    same as if you had caught-up the group without reading it.  This
;;    is the right way to "unread" an article, from the point of view of
;;    these adaptive scoring rules.
;;
;;  - If you kill an article or thread (using 'C-k'), it *seriously*
;;    dings the subject.  This is the way to drop a thread that got
;;    otherwise up-scored because of other scoring rules.
;;
;;  - If you mark an article as expirable (using 'E'), both the subject
;;    and the author are hugely dinged.  I impart this special meaning
;;    to the expirable mark because I don't use expirable marks for any
;;    other purpose (I use total expiry, or external expiration in tools
;;    like Leafnode).
;;
;;  - Scoring rules will decay after 30 days if they are not triggered
;;    again.  If a rule does get triggered, the 30 day counter resets.
;;    _Adaptive_ scoring rules are further "decayed" every day, so that
;;    they slowly migrate toward becoming disabled, rather than simply
;;    the "on/off" switch after 30 days that applies to normal scoring
;;    rules.
;;
;;  - If any article's score ends up beneath 0 -- but above
;;    `my-gnus-summary-expunge-below' -- it will still be in the
;;    *Summary* buffer, it just won't be visible.  Use '/ w' to reveal
;;    these silent articles.
;;
;;  - If any article's score ends up beneath
;;    `my-gnus-summary-expunge-below', it will not be in the *Summary*
;;    before at all.  You'll have to use '/ o' to pull in old articles
;;    to see these expunged articles (NOTE: This is not the same as
;;    IMAP's meaning of 'expunge', it just means it's not in the summary
;;    buffer at all).
;;
;; Some guidelines about proper using of scoring in Gnus:
;;
;; 1. Decide exactly which groups you will score in.  Configure
;;    `my-gnus-score-groups-regex' to reflect this.  For example, I only
;;    score for mailing lists and newsgroups.  Anything else, such as
;;    personal mail, should never see articles silently disappear from
;;    the *Summary* buffer.
;;
;; 2. Use manual scoring if necessary.  By default, this module uses
;;    adaptive scoring so that if you ignore threads, they ignore you
;;    right back.  But if you run across an author you really like, use
;;    'I A' to manually boost that person.  This may show you followups
;;    in future to threads you're currently ignoring.
