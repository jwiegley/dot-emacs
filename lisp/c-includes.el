;;; Commentary:

;; After setting `c-includes-path' appropriately, you can run the
;; command `M-x c-includes' to find all of the include files that get
;; brought in by a particular source file.
;;
;; It will create a buffer called "*Includes*" that will list all of
;; the included files, nested according to their inclusion depth.
;;
;; If you provide a prefix argument to `c-includes', it will ask you
;; for a regular expression, and will display all lines along the
;; include path containing that regular expression.  Pressing C-c C-c
;; on any of those lines will go that location.
;;
;; Lastly, for the programmer in all of us, if you call `c-includes'
;; non-interactively, and pass t as the second argument, it will
;; return back to you a list of the include file names, to do with as
;; you please.  See the docstring.

;;; History:

;; Changes in 1.4:

;; * `c-includes-mode-hook' now gets called in the *Includes* buffer
;;   after setting everything up.  This was simply an omission in 1.3.

;; Changes in 1.3:

;; * Made the *Includes* buffer use view-mode and outline-minor-mode,
;;   with `outline-regexp' set appropriately.
;;
;; * No longer relies upon font-lock for faces.
;;
;; * c-includes is not a minor mode anymore.  The *Includes* buffer is
;;   created as a regular temp buffer, with some additional keys set,
;;   and outline-minor-mode turned on.
;;
;; * Added the file `c-includes-current-file', which I recommend
;;   binding to C-c C-i in c++-mode and c-mode.  You can also achieve
;;   this by customizing `c-includes-binding' to t.
;;
;; * Change mousing behavior so that it doesn't change the window
;;   looking at the *Includes* buffer.
;;
;; * If you use C-c C-c on a line in the *Includes* which states that
;;   a certain include file is being opened or closed, that file will
;;   be visited.  Before, nothing would happen.
;;
;; * There are several variations now when mousing or using C-c C-c on
;;   a line that names an include file:
;;
;;   C-M-mouse-2
;;   C-u C-c C-c  moves point to any "corresponding" information
;;                on a "-" line, this goes to the "+" line
;;                on a "!" line, it goes to the first "+" line
;;
;;     M-mouse-2
;;   M-0 C-c C-c  open the file directly
;;
;;     S-mouse-2
;;   M-- C-c C-c  moves point in *Includes* to parent include file
;;                if you do this from a search-hit line, it will move
;;                point to the include file in which the match was
;;                found.
;;
;;       mouse-2
;;       C-c C-c  shows you where this file was #include'd
;;
;; * All of this special info is kept in text properties, rather than
;;   cluttering the buffer.
;;
;; * Special identifier characters now only occur at the beginning of
;;   the include file name.

;; Changes in 1.1:

;; * If a header can't be found, and has no extension, but there IS a
;;   header with an extension that has the same basename, then we
;;   assume that was the header that was meant.
;;
;; * The display is now ordered in the same way as what cpp would see,
;;   making your regexp searches more realistic.
;;
;; * Files included with double quotes are searched for first relative
;;   to the current directory.
;;
;; * `c-includes' now always asks for a regular expression, rather
;;   than relying on a prefix argument.
;;
;; * The mark gets pushed in the *Includes* buffer whenever you jump
;;   around, to enable you to get back easily.
;;
;; * When a file is included that has already been included, its name
;;   is now output, along with the line number within the *Includes*
;;   buffer where it was first included.  Pressing C-c C-c on that
;;   line will take you to the location of the first inclusion.
