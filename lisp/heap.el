;;; Commentary:
;;
;; A heap is a form of efficient self-sorting tree. In particular, the root
;; node is guaranteed to be the highest-ranked entry in the tree. (The
;; comparison function used for ranking the data can, of course, be freely
;; defined). Therefore repeatedly removing the root node will return the data
;; in order of increasing rank. They are often used as priority queues, for
;; scheduling tasks in order of importance.
;;
;; This package implements ternary heaps, since they are about 12% more
;; efficient than binary heaps for heaps containing more than about 10
;; elements, and for very small heaps the difference is negligible. The
;; asymptotic complexity of ternary heap operations is the same as for a
;; binary heap: 'add', 'delete-root' and 'modify' operations are all O(log n)
;; on a heap containing n elements.
;;
;; Note that this package implements a heap as an implicit data structure on a
;; vector. Therefore, the maximum size of the heap has to be specified in
;; advance. Although the heap will grow dynamically if it becomes full, this
;; requires copying the entire heap, so insertion has worst-case complexity
;; O(n) instead of O(log n), though the amortized complexity is still
;; O(log n). (For applications where the maximum size of the heap is not known
;; in advance, an implementation based on binary trees might be more suitable,
;; but is not currently implemented in this package.)
;;
;; You create a heap using `make-heap', add elements to it using `heap-add',
;; delete and return the root of the heap using `heap-delete-root', and modify
;; an element of the heap using `heap-modify'. A number of other heap
;; convenience functions are also provided, all with the prefix
;; `heap-'. Functions with prefix `heap--' are for internal use only, and
;; should never be used outside this package.
