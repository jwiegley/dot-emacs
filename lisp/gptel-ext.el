  "Make a synchronous GPT request and block until response is received.

This function wraps `gptel-request' to provide synchronous behavior,
blocking execution until the API response is complete. Returns the
response string from the language model.

PROMPT is the text input to send to the language model. If nil, uses the
current buffer contents or context.

Optional keyword arguments:

CALLBACK   - Function called with (RESPONSE INFO) after completion.
             Receives the model's response string and metadata plist.

BUFFER     - Buffer to use for the request context. Defaults to current
             buffer.

POSITION   - Position in buffer to insert response when :in-place is non-nil.

CONTEXT    - Additional context to include with the request.

DRY-RUN    - If non-nil, prepare request but don't actually send it.

STREAM     - If non-nil, enable streaming responses (not typically useful
             for synchronous requests).

IN-PLACE   - If non-nil, insert response directly into buffer at position.

SYSTEM     - System message/instructions for the model. Defaults to
             `gptel--system-message'.

TRANSFORMS - List of transformation functions to apply to response.

FSM        - Finite state machine for managing request state. Defaults
             to new FSM from `gptel-make-fsm'.

Returns the response string from the language model.
