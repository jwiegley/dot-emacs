(defun loeb-seq (fs)
  "The loeb function, implemented in Emacs Lisp.
Basically, you take a sequence of functions from a sequence to a
value, and calculate a sequence of values by passing the
\"final\" sequence to every one of those functions. But it's a
fixed point, so as long as it forms a DAG, the references all
work out.

Example:
  (loeb (list (lambda (xs) (length xs))
              (lambda (xs) (+ (thunk-force (nth 0 xs)) (length xs)))))
    ==> (2 4)"

Example:

                (bar . (lambda (alist) 2))))"
